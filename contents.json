Fast Company exposed the privacy issue, reporting that while the indexing did not include identifying information about users, some chats shared personal details that could potentially identify them. OpenAI's chief information security officer Dane Stuckey explained that all users whose chats were exposed opted in to indexing by clicking a box after choosing to share a chat, but the feature was designed misleadingly. OpenAI initially defended the labeling as 'sufficiently clear' but ultimately decided the feature 'introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn't intend to.'",
