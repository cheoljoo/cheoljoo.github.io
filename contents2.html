                <div class="summary">The luxury membership platform Vivrelle, which allows customers to rent high-end goods, announced Thursday the launch of an AI personal
styling tool called Ella
as part of its partnership with fashion retailers Revolve and FWRD. The launch is an example of how the fashion industry is leveraging AI technology to enhance customer experiences and is one of the first partnerships to see three retailers come together to offer a personalized AI experience. Revolve and FWRD let users shop designer clothing, while Revolve also has an option to shop pre-owned. The tool, Ella, provides recommendations to customers across the three retailers on what to purchase or rent to make an outfit come to life. For example, users can ask for “a bachelorette weekend outfit,” or “what to pack for a trip,” and the technology will search across the Vivrelle, FWRD, and Revolve shopping platforms to create outfit suggestions. Users can then check out in one cart on Vivrelle. In theory, the more one uses Ella, the better its suggestions become. It’s the fashion equivalent of asking ChatGPT what to wear in Miami for a girl’s weekend. Blake Geffen, the CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle (which announced a $62 million Series C earlier this year), told TechCrunch that she hopes Ella can take the “stress out of packing for a vacation or everyday dressing. “Ella has been in the works for quite some time,” she told TechCrunch, adding that it took about a year to build and release the product. This is actually the second AI tool from the three companies. The Vivrelle, Revolve, and FWRD partnership  earlier this year also launched Complete the Look, which offers last-minute fashion suggestions to complement what’s in a customer’s cart at checkout. Their latest tool, Ella, however, takes the fashion recommendation game to another level.</div>

The start of the COVID-19 pandemic is now five years in the rearview mirror, but its effects continue to reverberate. While those leading the US healthcare system have embraced
conspiracy theories
and
junk science
to justify a reduced focus on vaccines (particularly the COVID jab) many people are still seeking out immunization. Google Maps isn&#x27;t a good way to find it, though. In recent days, almost all search results for COVID vaccines have vanished from Google Maps. In both the mobile app and website, Google Maps returns zero results for terms like &quot;COVID vaccine&quot; and simply &quot;vaccines.&quot; We&#x27;ve tested and confirmed this in multiple US regions, as well as internationally. In some places, these searches will return no local results but may include links to facilities hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, searches for less-contentious injections like &quot;flu vaccine&quot; and &quot;shingles vaccine&quot; continue to get local results. The
Food and Drug Administration
under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently approved the
updated COVID shot
, but the agency only recommends it for those with underlying health conditions and people over age 65. That makes boosters harder for many Americans to get—and the first step is often finding a nearby provider of immunization. For at least the last week, Google Maps has returned no results for those vaccine-related queries. Results for the flu vaccine appear in Maps, but not COVID.</div>

Hook v3 uses fake Google Pay overlays to trick victims into surrendering sensitive card data
Real-time screen streaming allows attackers to spy directly on victims
GitHub repositories host malicious APKs, spreading advanced malware more widely
Hook v3, the latest variant of the long-running Hook Android banking trojan
malware
, introduces an unusually wide range of capabilities, experts have warned. Researchers at
Zimperium zLabs
claim the malware now supports 107 remote commands, with 38 added in the latest update, and it continues to exploit Android Accessibility Services. Its expanded functionality suggests a shift from narrow banking fraud to a more versatile threat platform - potentially putting many more victims at risk. You may like

In their report, the researchers outline how Hook v3 can steal personal data, hijack user sessions, and bypass device defenses. “Hook v3 blurs the line between banking trojans, spyware, and ransomware,” said Nico Chiaraviglio, Chief Scientist at Zimperium. “Its rapid evolution and wide-scale distribution elevate the threat to financial institutions, enterprises, and mobile users worldwide.</div>

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge
might be made for you. Samsung’s ultra-slim Android phone features the same 6.7-inch OLED display as the Galaxy S25 Plus, but the device’s 5.8mm thick design makes it feel completely different. Right now, you can grab the S25 Edge with 256GB of storage in

for an all-time low price of $699.99 ($400 off) at Amazon.</div>

. ExpressVPN switches to multi-tiered pricing with more feature options
The VPN provider now offers three types of plan at three lengths each, giving users more control over how they subscribe. Sam Chapman

ExpressVPN
has tripled its subscription options by switching to a tiered pricing structure, effective today. The new system includes three levels of service, the cheapest offering basic VPN service and the others adding extra features. Each one of those levels — Basic, Advanced and Pro — can be purchased for monthly, yearly or two-year durations. In total, you&#x27;ve now got nine different options for subscribing to ExpressVPN. The company also says legacy plans will remain active &quot;for now,&quot; and current customers won&#x27;t be downgraded. The change is similar to the approach already used by rivals like
NordVPN
and
Surfshark
. Previously, ExpressVPN locked feature offerings to the duration of the plan, so the only way to get the full suite of features was to subscribe for 24 months. Now, while longer-term subscriptions will still offer discounts, features depend on your level of subscription instead of how long it lasts. Advertisement

The new tiers roll in some features that were previously part of ExpressVPN&#x27;s Identity Defender suite, including identity monitoring, credit reports and data removal services. New types of plans will also bump the number of allowed simultaneous connections to as high as 14. Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get with each tier. ExpressVPN
The Basic plan comes with &quot;core VPN functionality,&quot; which includes the Lightway protocol, the Network Lock kill switch and split tunneling on Windows, Android and macOS 10 and below.</div>

                <div class="summary">Scale AI, which helps tech companies prepare data to train their AI models, filed a lawsuit against one of its former sales employees and its rival Mercor on Wednesday. The suit claims the employee, who was hired by Mercor, “stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information,” according to a copy seen by TechCrunch. Scale is suing Mercor for misappropriation of trade secrets and is suing the former employee, Eugene Ling, for breach of contract. The suit also claims the employee was trying to pitch Mercor to one of Scale’s largest customers before he officially left his former job. The suit calls this company “Customer A.”
Mercor co-founder Surya Midha denies that his company used any data from Scale, although he admits that Ling may have been in possession of some. “While Mercor has hired many people who departed Scale, we have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way. Eugene informed us that he had old documents in a personal Google Drive, which we have never accessed and are now investigating,” Midha told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “We reached out to Scale six days ago offering to have Eugene destroy the files or reach a different resolution, and we are now awaiting their response,” Midha said. Scale alleges that these documents contained the specific data that would allow Mercor to serve Customer A, as well as several other of Scale’s most important clients. Scale wanted Mercor to give it a full list of the files in the drive, and to prevent Ling from working with Customer A. It alleges in the suit that Mercor refused. Ling did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Techcrunch event

Queen once asked, &quot;
Who wants to live forever
?&quot; And while the band&#x27;s frontman Freddie Mercury only made it into his 40s, the song&#x27;s question continues to haunt people—especially aging tyrants who fear that the icy hand of death is upon their shoulder and want far more time to ensure both national and personal glory. At a Beijing gathering this week, China&#x27;s Xi Jinping, Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Putin, and North Korea&#x27;s Kim Jong Un met to commemorate Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. The three men and their translators were caught on hot mics having an &quot;unscripted moment&quot; in which the conversation turned to life extensions and immortality. &quot;Earlier, people rarely lived to 70, but these days at 70 years you are still a child,&quot; Xi told the other two,
according to Bloomberg
. (This is gross hyperbole, of course, as China&#x27;s
overall life expectancy rate is 77.6
, while
in Russia it is just 70
—below the global average of 71.4. The US average is 76.4.)
Putin then responded with the somewhat creepy claim that, thanks to biotech, &quot;human organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality.&quot;
Xi then responded with the claim that people may live to 150 by the end of this century. In a later press conference, Putin confirmed the discussion and said that &quot;life expectancy will increase significantly&quot; in the near future and &quot;we should also think about this&quot; in terms of political and economic consequences.</div>

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.

OpenAI rolls out ChatGPT Projects to free users
The formerly paid feature acts as a folder system for organizing AI chats. Ian Carlos Campbell

OpenAI
OpenAI
has announced
that it&#x27;s making its Projects feature available to free users of ChatGPT. Projects let you organize chats with the company&#x27;s AI assistant around a specific subject, and were previously one of several privileges only enjoyed by paid subscribers. While on some level Projects are glorified folders for ChatGPT conversations, the ability to set custom instructions for how the AI responds or limit what information and files it can reference, makes the feature a useful option for power users. As part of this rollout, OpenAI is also increasing the number of files that can be added to a project for ChatGPT to reference. Free users can upload five, Plus subscribers can upload 25 and Pro subscribers can upload 40. Whether you pay for ChatGPT or not, you&#x27;ll also be able to customize the color and icon for your project, too. OpenAI has made a habit of slowly trickling down paid features to its free users over the last few years. Things like
Deep Research
and
ChatGPT Voice
started off as exclusives for the company&#x27;s subscribers before becoming available to everyone. Offering a formerly premium feature with limits is itself a way to get free customers to become paid ones. OpenAI&#x27;s decision to make the recently released
GPT-5 model
available to everyone at launch, but with harsher limits on how many times free users can use it follows a similar logic. Projects are available for free users on the web and in the ChatGPT app for Android. OpenAI says the iOS ChatGPT app will receive the feature &quot;over the coming days.&quot;
