                <div class="summary">Recession fears aren’t hurting the wishlist and shopping app GoWish, which is seeing record numbers ahead of the 2025 holiday season. The app, which has north of 13.6 million registered users, had its best day yet this week, when on Monday it hit No. 2 on the U.S. App Store. While GoWish has seen similar adoption trends in previous years, this year has proven to be a breakout success. The app doubled the number of users from last year, and it has been breaking records with hundreds of thousands of new daily users in the month of November. In the U.S. alone, the app has nearly 6.2 million users, while it has around 1 million in the U.K. In its home market of Denmark, the wishlist app has over 50% market penetration and over 3.5 million registered Danish users. Though today it operates as a tech company, GoWish has a unique origin story. Image Credits:
GoWish
The app was originally launched in 2015 by the Danish-Swedish national postal service PostNord as “Ønskeskyen.” (That’s Danish for “wish cloud.”) It was just a seasonal wishlist gimmick, but its founders saw the potential for it to be something more. In 2020, GoWish was acquired by Danish VC Dotcom Capital, which is owned by founder Casper Ravn‑Sørensen, who is also GoWish’s Chief Growth Officer, and his partner, CEO Mads Dahlerup. They spun it out as an independent tech company and created an international version of Ønskeskyen (the app’s name in Denmark and Norway). “We might be the first state-founded tech platform to go global as a privately-owned scale-up,” Ravn‑Sørensen told TechCrunch.

Consumers can use the app to create multiple wishlists for themselves, their family and friends, and for different occasions. Wishes — or products you can buy from online retailers — can be added directly to your list by copying and pasting a URL, searching for a product, or browsing the inspiration feeds that feature millions of products.</div>

Another day, another malware attack on smartphones. Researchers at Unit 42, the threat intelligence arm of Palo Alto Networks, have revealed a sophisticated spyware known as “Landfall” targeting Samsung Galaxy phones. The researchers say this campaign leveraged a zero-day exploit in Samsung Android software to steal a raft of personal data, and it was active for almost a year. Thankfully, the underlying vulnerability has now been patched, and the attacks were most likely targeted at specific groups. Unit 42 says
that Landfall first appeared in July 2024, relying on a software flaw now catalogued as CVE-2025-21042. Samsung issued a patch for its phones in April 2025, but details of the attack have only been revealed now. Even if you were out there poking around the darker corners of the Internet in 2024 and early 2025 with a Samsung Galaxy device, it’s unlikely you’d be infected. The team believes Landfall was used in the Middle East to target individuals for surveillance. It is currently unclear who was behind the attacks. Landfall is particularly devious because it’s what’s known as a zero-click attack, which can compromise a system without the user’s direct involvement. Unit 42 only spotted Landfall because of two similar bugs that were
patched in Apple iOS
and WhatsApp. When combined, these two exploits would enable remote code execution, so the team went looking for exploits that might do that. They found several malicious image files uploaded to VirusTotal that revealed the Landfall attack.</div>

Much of the appeal of any Disney park is that you can step inside some of your favorite universes – be it
Star Wars
at Galaxy’s Edge
, complete with walking, talking, beeping
BDX droids
, or a bar fit for Jack Sparrow at
The Beak and Barrel
. And while guests can visit
Zootopia
at Shanghai Disney, there’s now another way to explore the animal-filled metropolis. Opening today – November 7, 2025 – at Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, is a new immersive 4D show,
Zootopia: Better Zoogether! . It replaces the long-standing
It’s Tough to Be a Bug
show (themed to the film
A Bug&#x27;s Life
) inside the Tree of Life Theater near the front of the park and marks the park’s first new attraction in years. The
Zootopia
show debuts as the Animal Kingdom park undergoes major changes, including a new
Indiana Jones
-themed ride and an
Encanto
attraction in the
upcoming Tropical Americas land
. TechRadar had the chance to preview the new 4D show ahead of its opening, experiencing the production – created by the same animation team behind
Zootopia 2
– and getting an up-close look at an all-new animatronic from Walt Disney Imagineering.</div>
