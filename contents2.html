                <div class="summary">This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise
$300 billion, five-year agreement
, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure. On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it. Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors. “OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”
Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before, and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business. “Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.</div>

Here&#x27;s some good news for a Friday afternoon: For 2025 through August, global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024, according to the analysts at Rho Motion. That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total. However, that&#x27;s for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain. But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year. Tesla has seen none of this sales growth in Europe, however—as we noted last month, this region&#x27;s Tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in July. China had bought an additional 7.6 million new EVs between January and August of this year, although this growth slowed in July and August, partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to Chinese government policies. And as also noted last month, BYD recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900,000 vehicles (down to 4.6 million) for this year.</div>

Tyler Robinson, apprehended last night in connection to the
fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk
, allegedly left engraved bullets at the crime scene that were covered in a furry meme, a reference from the video game
Helldivers 2,
and an extremely online taunt. In an FBI briefing this morning about his arrest, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox described the sequence of events that led to the capture of Robinson, 22, who was turned into the police by his father. They also clarified the nature of the notes engraved on the bullet casings found at the scene, which had been rumored to be slogans relating to antifascist and “transgender ideology.” As it turns out, the messages are a confusing mix of internet memes and pop culture. As described, the bullets read (exact capitalization not confirmed at this point):
“Notices bulges OWO what’s this?”
“Hey fascist!</div>

Instagram fixed an issue that caused posting multiple Stories to tank your reach
That doesn&#x27;t mean all your followers will watch or like every Story, though. Ian Carlos Campbell

Instagram fixed a bug that caused the reach of some users&#x27; Stories to shrink when they posted more than one Story a day, Instagram head Adam Mosseri
shared on Friday
. The fix addresses a
common complaint
shared by creators
in the last year that they were disincentivized to use Stories because of how regularly using the feature impacted the number of people who actually saw their posts. &quot;People were complaining about getting less reach with their Stories if they posted lots of Stories in the same day,&quot; Mosseri said in a video announcing the change. &quot;That is not at all the intended behavior of Instagram.&quot; Fixing the bug doesn&#x27;t mean every Story you add will be watched, but Mosseri says posting multiple Stories a day won&#x27;t negatively impact the reach of your Stories overall, especially your first Story. For anyone who primarily uses Instagram to keep up with their friends, the change might not matter all that much. But much like YouTube, Instagram is an increasingly professionalized platform where people post in the hopes of expanding their reach and earning a living off their content. That creates an interesting dynamic between Mosseri&#x27;s regular announcements and users trying to suss out the nuances of the platform&#x27;s algorithm. For every new feature, like
adding of comments to Stories
, there&#x27;s subtler tweaks that can totally change creators&#x27; content strategy. Advertisement

                <div class="summary">Australia, with the assistance of Anduril, has successfully moved to deploy a fleet of XL uncrewed undersea vehicles (XLUUV) named &quot;Ghost Shark&quot; by next year, under a significant AUS$1.7 billion contract. This achievement highlights Australia&#x27;s political urgency to enhance its defense capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region against the rising threat from China. The project, co-developed and jointly funded by Anduril and Australia, delivered its first prototype ahead of schedule, contrasting sharply with the delayed XLUUV development in the United States. The contract covers delivery, maintenance, and continued development of the platform, which is designed for long-range, stealthy surveillance and strike operations.</div>

This expands on the Community Notes system, which replaced Meta&#x27;s fact-checking program earlier this year. While users must still apply to write notes, the new test enables broader participation in rating their helpfulness and requesting notes for potentially incorrect or misleading posts. Additionally, a new notification system will alert users who interact with posts that receive a Community Note. Despite over 70,000 contributors, only six percent of written notes have been published, indicating the feature is still in early stages.</div>
