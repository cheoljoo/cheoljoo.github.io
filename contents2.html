Taco Bell is having second thoughts about relying on AI at the drive-through
Taco Bell’s chief digital officer says the company is having an “active conversation” about when to use and not to use AI.
The company has apparently rolled out voice AI-powered ordering at more than 500 drive-throughs, leading to unflattering viral moments like someone
ordering 18,000 water cups
in order to “bypass” the AI and get connected to a human server.
Chief Digital and Technology Officer
Dane Matthews told The Wall Street Journal
that even he has mixed experiences with technology: “Sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me.”
Overall, it sounds like Taco Bell is still deciding how broadly to deploy AI at the drive-through, with leeway for different franchisees to do things their own way. For example, rather than relying on AI exclusively, Matthews said it might make sense to have a human handle drive-through orders at busy restaurants with long lines.
“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,” he said.

Texas suit alleging anti-coal “cartel” of top Wall Street firms could reshape ESG
It’s a closely watched test of whether corporate alliances on climate efforts violate antitrust laws.

Since 2022, Republican lawmakers in Congress and state attorneys general have sent letters to major
banks
,
pension funds
,
asset managers
,
accounting firms
,
companies
,
nonprofits
, and
business alliances
, putting them on notice for potential antitrust violations and seeking information as part of the Republican pushback against “environmental, social and governance” efforts such as corporate climate commitments.
“This caused a lot of turmoil and stress obviously across the whole ecosystem,” said Denise Hearn, a senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “But everyone wondered, ‘OK, when are they actually going to drop a lawsuit?’”
That
came in November
, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other Republican AGs, accusing three of the biggest asset managers on Wall Street—BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street—of running “an investment cartel” to depress the output of coal and boosting their revenues while pushing up energy costs for Americans. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission filed a supporting
brief
in May.
The overall pressure campaign aimed at what’s known as “ESG” is having an impact.</div>

The iconic floppy disk is reborn as a storage case for today&#x27;s terabyte-packing SD cards
From 1.44MB past to terabyte present, the new design bridges eras creatively
Fun artwork references glitch aesthetics and retro computing
Floppy disks are unquestionably a relic from the past, although they still keep resurfacing in unusual places - most recently, surfacing in the
American prison service
, and an enterprising YouTuber set out to
build a floppy disk from scratch
.
If you&#x27;re of a certain age, you&#x27;ll no doubt still remember the feeling of sliding a floppy disk into a computer, hearing that quiet click, and waiting as files loaded bit by bit. That memory will come rushing back with the Floppy Disk-Inspired SD Card Packaging, a design concept created by Indian industrial designer Ayushmaan Singh Jodha for SanDisk.
It takes the iconic 3.5-inch floppy and reimagines it as a different kind of storage device - as a case for today’s
SD cards
.

From megabytes to terabytes
Where a floppy once held 1.44MB, this design protects cards that now carry gigabytes or even terabytes.
The idea bridges eras of technology in a fun way, but with a serious practical purpose.</div>

For the last week or two,
reports
have been circulating that recent Windows 11 updates (specifically KB5063878 and KB5062660) were causing some SSDs using Phison controllers to fail. Tech influencers on
YouTube
and
TikTok
were quick to jump on the reports of corrupted data and disappearing drives, laying the blame squarely at Microsoft’s feet. We’re not saying any company is above lying to the public, and Microsoft has a
history
of
rocky
update
rollouts
, but both Microsoft and Phison claim they’ve been unable to recreate the issue.
Phison said it was made aware of reports that the Windows update was causing drives to fail on August 18th and began investigating the issue. Then it
issued a statement
on August 27th saying that after running over 2,200 test cycles totaling more than 4,500 hours it was, “unable to reproduce the reported issue, and no partners or customers have reported that the issue affected their drives at this time.</div>

What to read this weekend: Two thrilling horror novels in one
And the gritty new miniseries, The Voice Said Kill, from Image Comics.
Cheyenne MacDonald
Weekend Editor
Sat, August 30, 2025 at 8:15 PM UTC
These are some recently released titles we think are worth adding to your reading list. This week, we picked up the Saga Doubles release of Stephen Graham Jones&#x27;
Killer on the Road
and
The Babysitter Lives
, and the new Image Comics miniseries,
The Voice Said Kill
.
S&amp;S/Saga Press
Killer on the Road/The Babysitter Lives (Saga Doubles)
Once again (or twice, really, because this book is two novels in one), Stephen Graham Jones delivers on some really gripping, fun horror that spins some classic tropes into something unexpected. This double feature contains
The Babysitter Lives
and
Killer on the Road,
the first being a story about a night of babysitting gone horribly, supernaturally wrong on the eve of Halloween, and the latter a road trip from hell situation in which a hitchhiker-targeting serial killer sets his sights on a runaway teen and her friends.
The Babysitter Lives
was previously available as an audiobook exclusive, so fans may already be familiar with that one.
Killer on the Road
hooks you immediately with its &quot;Chapter 0&quot; cold open, which pretty much gives you a sense of how things are going to be from then on out (brutal). It&#x27;s wonderful in the gory, stressful, horrifying-but-also-humorous way SGJ does so well.
The Babysitter Lives
is a brutal and chaotic time, too, and it managed to genuinely give me the creeps when I stayed up way too late reading it. Without giving too much away, something ain&#x27;t right about the house this babysitter shows up to work at. These were so fun to read.</div>

                <div class="summary">It’s only been since June that Meta invested
$14.3 billion
in the data-labeling vendor Scale AI, bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang and several of the startup’s top executives to run Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). But the relationship between the two companies is already showing signs of fraying.
At least one of the executives Wang brought over to help run MSL — Scale AI’s former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product and Operations, Ruben Mayer — has departed Meta after just two months with the company, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.
Mayer spent roughly five years with Scale AI across two stints. In his short time at Meta, according to those sources, Mayer oversaw AI data operations teams but wasn’t part of the company’s TBD Labs — the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence, where top AI researchers from OpenAI have landed.
However, Mayer disputes some details about his role, telling TechCrunch that his initial position was “to help set up the lab, with whatever was needed” rather than data, and that he was “part of TBD Labs from day one” rather than being excluded from the core AI unit. Mayer also clarified that he “did not report directly to [Wang]” and was “very happy” with his Meta experience.
Beyond the personnel changes, Meta’s relationship with Scale AI appears to be shifting. TBD Labs is working with third-party data labeling vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models, according to five people familiar with the matter. Those third-party vendors include Mercor and Surge, two of Scale AI’s largest competitors, the people said.
While AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors – Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up –  it’s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor.</div>

“With volatility now the norm, security and risk leaders need practical guidance on managing existing spending and new budgetary necessities,” states
Forrester’s 2026 Budget Planning Guide
, revealing a fundamental shift in how organizations allocate cybersecurity resources.

40%
of cybersecurity spending, exceeding hardware at
15.8%
, outsourcing at
15%
and surpassing personnel costs at
29%

Three converging threats are flipping cybersecurity on its head: what once protected organizations is now working against them. Generative AI (gen AI) is enabling attackers to craft 10,000 personalized phishing emails per minute using scraped LinkedIn profiles and corporate communications.
NIST’s 2030 quantum deadline
threatens retroactive decryption of
$425 billion
in currently protected data. Deepfake fraud that
surged 3,000% in 2024
now bypasses biometric authentication in
97%
of attempts, forcing security leaders to reimagine defensive architectures fundamentally.

Words have meaning. Proper word selection is integral to strong communication, whether it&#x27;s about relaying one’s feelings to another or explaining the terms of a deal, agreement, or transaction.
Language can be confusing, but typically when something is available to &quot;buy,&quot; ownership of that good or access to that service is offered in exchange for money. That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content.
Often, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking &quot;buy&quot; means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.
A lawsuit
[PDF]
recently filed against Prime Video challenges this practice and accuses the streaming service of misleading customers by labeling long-term rentals as purchases. The conclusion of the case could have implications for how streaming services frame digital content.
New lawsuit against Prime Video
On August 21, Lisa Reingold filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California against Amazon, alleging &quot;false and misleading advertising.&quot; The complaint, citing
Prime Video’s terms of use
, reads:
On its website, Defendant tells consumers the option to &#x27;buy&#x27; or &#x27;purchase&#x27; digital copies of these audiovisual works.</div>

Here’s how it works

Jeremy Irvine (Henry) and Hermione Corfield (Julia) in
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
.
(Image credit: Starz)
While it doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise, the drama has been fully kicking off in
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
. Without giving too much away, episode 5 of the
Starz
show followed Julia (Hermione Corfield) losing her carefully assembled allies after the spilling of secrets, Henry&#x27;s (Jeremy Irvine) little hope that he has left starting to slip away, and Ellen (Harriet Slater) and Brian (Jamie Roy) having a lovely time celebrating Beltane. Lucky for some.
We&#x27;ve still got no idea how, or if, the original
Outlander
cast are going to directly cross-over with
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
(though it is technically possible), and with another five episodes still to go, we can&#x27;t rule anything out. But when I had a chance to ask Irvine and Corfield exactly what that might be, surprises are coming much sooner than we first thought.
Next week&#x27;s episode 6 is going to be a particularly challenging one – both for us watching and when the cast initially filmed it.
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
fans should particularly keep an eye on on Julia, who&#x27;s about to have &quot;one of her biggest episodes.</div>
