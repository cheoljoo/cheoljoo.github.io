                <div class="summary">On an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down as it expands the use cases for visual AI.
The image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers’ first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant.
However, investors wanted to know what Pinterest’s opportunity in agentic commerce — AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users — was given the rapidly changing AI landscape, and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential.
That question has become more pressing. During the company’s third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a
weaker holiday shopping season
than expected, citing President Donald Trump’s tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. As a result, Pinterest’s fourth-quarter revenue is expected to come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.34 billion, on average. The news sent the stock tumbling by more than 21% on Wednesday.
Despite the near-term revenue concerns, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. In addition to its own proprietary models that are already accounted for in its cost structure, Ready said the company tests leading off-the-shelf models against open-source options on a regular basis, and found the open-source models promising.
“One of the really, really interesting things that we’re seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,” Ready told investors.</div>

Google Cloud
has introduced a big update in a bid to keep AI d
evelopers on its Vertex AI platform for concepting, designing, building, testing, deploying and modifying AI agents in enterprise use cases.
The new features, announced today, include additional governance tools for enterprises and expanding the capabilities for creating agents with just a few lines of code, moving faster with state-of-the-art context management layers and one-click deployment, as well as managed services for scaling production and evaluation, and support for identifying agents.
Agent Builder,
released last year
during its annual Cloud Next event, provides a no-code platform for enterprises to create agents and connect these to orchestration frameworks like LangChain.
Google’s
Agent Development Kit
(ADK), which lets developers build agents “in under 100 lines of code,” can also be accessed through Agent Builder.
“These new capabilities underscore our commitment to Agent Builder, and simplify the agent development process to meet developers where they are, no matter which tech stack they choose,” said Mike Clark, director of Product Management, Vertex AI Agent Builder.
Build agents faster
Part of Google’s pitch for Agent Builder’s new features is that enterprises can bake in-orchestration even as they construct their agents.
“Building an agent from a concept to a working product involves complex orchestration,” said Clark.
The new capabilities, which are shipped with the ADK, include:
SOTA context management layers including Static, Turn, User and Cache layers so enterprises have more control over the agents’ context
Prebuilt plugins with customizable logic.</div>

Google and Disney have been in a contract dispute since October 30 that has resulted in YouTube TV subscribers losing access to
21 Disney-owned TV channels
, including ABC, ESPN, and The Disney Channel.
In addition to reducing access to popular live content, the corporate conflict is highlighting another frustration in the streaming era. As Google and Disney continue duking it out, their customers have lost some access to content they thought was permanent: DVR files and digital movie purchases.
A perk of subscribing to YouTube TV, per
Google’s marketing
, is the ability to “record it all with unlimited DVR space.” A footnote on the YouTube TV homepage notes that unlimited DVR is subject to “device, regional, and Internet restrictions” but overlooks an additional restriction in the form of multi-conglomerate spats.
YouTube TV’s
terms of service
does state that Google may remove users’ DVR recordings when “Google is asked to delete or remove access to a recording” and that “subscribers are not granted any rights or license by use of recording functions.” But people often neglect to locate, read, and comprehend complex and verbose terms of service.
Once YouTube TV lost Disney content, Google also made this discretion apparent via a
support page
that reads:
Recordings of Disney content will be removed. If we’re able to reach an agreement with Disney and bring their content back to YouTube TV, subscribers will regain access to recordings that were previously in their library.
One could be forgiven for assuming they had greater control over DVR recordings from YouTube TV.</div>

Experts tore an MIT paper apart for making evidence-free AI claims
Kevin Beaumont dismissed the findings as almost complete nonsense with no proof
Marcus Hutchins also mocked the research, saying he laughed harder reading its methods
MIT Sloan School of Management has been forced to withdraw a working paper which claimed AI played a “significant role” in most ransomware attacks after widespread criticism from experts.
The study, co-authored by MIT researchers and executives from Safe Security, alleged that “80.83 percent of recorded ransomware events were attributed to threat actors utilizing AI.”
Published earlier in 2025 and later cited by several outlets, the report drew immediate scrutiny for presenting extraordinary figures with little evidence.

Dubious research
Among them were prominent security researcher Kevin Beaumont, who described the paper as “absolutely ridiculous,” calling its findings, “almost complete nonsense.”
&quot;It describes almost every major ransomware group as using AI – without any evidence (it&#x27;s also not true, I monitor many of them),” Beaumont wrote in
a Mastodon thread
“It even talks about Emotet (which hasn&#x27;t existed for many years) as being AI driven,&quot;.</div>

With the swing of a bat, another October came and went for those of us who love baseball. As languid and habitual as the rest of the season can feel, October baseball at its best is pure chaos: Night after night, there’s a promise of something new, that you might see something that’s never happened before and get to talk about it for years to come. The winner-takes-all Game 7 on Saturday, between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers, was one of those nights — and maybe, hopefully, the beginning for a whole new group of fans.
Around 26 million people in the US watched the game on Saturday, making it the
most-watched World Series game
since 2017.</div>

The Foursquare founder&#x27;s new app is an AI-powered &#x27;DJ&#x27; for neighborhood updates
BeeBot is an &quot;app for AirPods&quot; that combines AI, audio and location-based social features.

Add Engadget on Google
BeeBot is an AI DJ made for AirPods from the founder of Foursqaure.
(App Store)
Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley has unveiled his latest venture and yes, it&#x27;s another location-based social app. But, rather than the check-ins Crowley first popularized more than 15 years ago, &quot;BeeBot&quot; has a very 2025 take on the concept. Instead, the app is an AI-powered &quot;DJ&quot; that can deliver contextual audio updates to your ears as you move through your day.
Crowley describes BeeBot as an &quot;app for AirPods,&quot; though it will work with any type of headphones, as well as smart glasses with audio capabilities like Meta&#x27;s. &quot;Whenever you put your AirPods in, it turns on,&quot; Crowley explains in
a post
on Medium. &quot;Whenever you take your AirPods out it turns off. And when it’s &#x27;on&#x27; it’ll push you snippets of audio about the people, places, and events that are nearby.&#x27;
To do this, you&#x27;ll need to give the app access to your location and share a handful of &quot;keywords&quot; about your interests. You can also share your contacts to get updates from friends who are using the app. The BeeBot &quot;DJ,&quot; which of course has an AI voice, will then be able to talk to you as you throughout the dat and alert you to interesting events, landmarks or updates from friends who happen to be nearby.
In some ways, it sounds like Crowley is trying to re-create some of the serendipitous IRL social interactions enabled by the original version of Foursquare. BeeBot doesn&#x27;t have &quot;mayorships,&quot; badges or any of the gamification features that helped popularize FourSquare, but it&#x27;s meant to have some of the &quot;same playful spirit,&quot; of OG Foursquare, according to Crowley.</div>
