OpenAI aims to compete with platforms like Meta&#x27;s Vibes, TikTok, and Instagram. Sora has faced criticism for deepfakes and copyrighted characters, leading to policy changes and a legal dispute over its “Cameo” feature.</div>

                <div class="summary">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company&#x27;s annual revenue exceeds $13 billion, addressing concerns about its ability to fund over $1 trillion in computing infrastructure commitments for the next decade. During a Bg2 podcast interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Altman reacted testily to host Brad Gerstner&#x27;s questions regarding these financial reports. Altman asserted that revenue is growing steeply and challenged critics, suggesting they would eagerly buy OpenAI shares or short the stock if it were public, anticipating they would &quot;get burned&quot;. He acknowledged potential pitfalls, such as failing to secure sufficient computing resources, but expressed confidence in the company&#x27;s financial trajectory.</div>

                <div class="summary">This article introduces a new paradigm in CPU architecture: deterministic, time-based execution, moving away from the long-standing speculative execution model. Speculative execution, dominant since the 1990s, aimed to prevent pipeline stalls by predicting branch outcomes and memory loads, leading to significant performance gains. However, it incurred costs like wasted energy from failed predictions, increased complexity, and security vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown.

Inspired by David Patterson&#x27;s principle of simplicity, a new deterministic model has emerged. This breakthrough, detailed in six U.S. patents, assigns each instruction a precise execution slot using a simple time counter. This time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism replaces guesswork with a time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism. Each instruction is assigned a precise execution slot within the pipeline, resulting in a rigorously ordered and predictable flow of execution. This reimagined model redefines how modern processors can handle latency and concurrency with greater efficiency and reliability.</div>

Outages stemmed from diverse causes, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, accidental cable damage (like a stray bullet in Texas or Red Sea cable cuts affecting Microsoft Azure), and government-imposed restrictions. State-ordered blackouts remain a primary culprit, with Iraq, Syria, and Sudan routinely shutting down internet access during national examination periods to combat cheating.</div>
