                <div class="summary">OpenAI unveiled its AI browser,
ChatGPT Atlas
, during a livestream on Tuesday. There are other AI browsers such as
The Browser Company’s Dia
,
Opera’s Neon
,
Perplexity’s Comet
, and General Catalyst-backed
Strawberry
. OpenAI’s launch is notable because of the sheer scale of reaching potentially 800 million of its weekly ChatGPT users. For the company, the browser is much more about keeping ChatGPT central than about making web browsing better.
While Atlas is currently available only on the Mac, the company is already working on bringing it to Windows, iOS, and Android — all the surfaces where ChatGPT already exists. OpenAI has also made the browser available to all users instead of opting for an invite system like its rivals. The core proposition of the browser is for you to think of ChatGPT as the first interaction surface for search and answers instead of Google.
All the AI browsers share a similar idea about search and Q&amp;A. Instead of performing a search query, you would type something in your address bar to get answers from an AI chatbot, instead of looking at pages of links.
And OpenAI, just like other browser makers, thinks that Atlas will change the way you browse the web, as Sam Altman made clear at the launch. “We think AI represents once in a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be, how to use one, and how to most productively use the web. Tabs were great but there hasn’t been a lot of innovation since then,” Altman said in his opening speech.
Tech leaders, including
Sundar Pichai
and
Satya Nadella
,
have talked about AI as a platform shift. However, for consumers, phones and desktop operating systems are still the primary way to get to their AI tools. OpenAI wants to own the pipes of distribution of ChatGPT as much as it can. Last week, Meta shut its doors to third-party chatbots, including
ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp
, which has over 3 billion monthly users.</div>

Simplifying the AI stack: The key to scalable, portable intelligence from cloud to edge
Arm
October 22, 2025
Presented by Arm
A simpler software stack is the key to portable, scalable AI across cloud and edge.
AI is now powering real-world applications, yet fragmented software stacks are holding it back. Developers routinely rebuild the same models for different hardware targets, losing time to glue code instead of shipping features. The good news is that a shift is underway. Unified toolchains and optimized libraries are making it possible to deploy models across platforms without compromising performance.
Yet one critical hurdle remains: software complexity. Disparate tools, hardware-specific optimizations, and layered tech stacks continue to bottleneck progress. To unlock the next wave of AI innovation, the industry must pivot decisively away from siloed development and toward streamlined, end-to-end platforms.
This transformation is already taking shape. Major cloud providers, edge platform vendors, and open-source communities are converging on unified toolchains that simplify development and accelerate deployment, from cloud to edge. In this article, we’ll explore why simplification is the key to scalable AI, what’s driving this momentum, and how next-gen platforms are turning that vision into real-world results.
The bottleneck: fragmentation, complexity, and inefficiency
The issue isn’t just hardware variety; it’s duplicated effort across frameworks and targets that slows time-to-value.
Diverse hardware targets
: GPUs, NPUs, CPU-only devices, mobile SoCs, and custom accelerators.
Tooling and framework fragmentation
: TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, MediaPipe, and others.
Edge constraints
: Devices require real-time, energy-efficient performance with minimal overhead.
According to
Gartner Research
, these mismatches create a key hurdle: over 60% of AI initiatives stall before production, driven by integration complexity and performance variability.</div>

Once upon a time, two villagers visited the fabled Mullah Nasreddin. They hoped that the Sufi philosopher, famed for his acerbic wisdom, could mediate a dispute that had driven a wedge between them. Nasreddin listened patiently to the first villager’s version of the story and, upon its conclusion, exclaimed, “You are absolutely right!” The second villager then presented his case. After hearing him out, Nasreddin again responded, “You are absolutely right!” An observant bystander, confused by Nasreddin’s proclamations, interjected, “But Mullah, they can’t both be right.” Nasreddin paused, regarding the bystander for a moment before replying, “You are absolutely right, too!”
In late May, the White House’s first “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report was criticized for citing multiple research studies that did not exist. Fabricated citations like these are common in the outputs of generative artificial intelligence based on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs have presented plausible-sounding sources, catchy titles, or even false data to craft their conclusions. Here, the White House pushed back on the journalists who first broke the story before admitting to “
minor citation errors
.”
It is ironic that fake citations were used to support a principal recommendation of the MAHA report: addressing the health research sector’s “
replication crisis
,” wherein scientists’ findings often cannot be reproduced by other independent teams.
Yet the MAHA report’s use of phantom evidence is far from unique.</div>

The 2mm-thick mSSD reaches 6500MB/s write speeds despite its size
Longsys eliminates nearly 1,000 solder joints through wafer-level integration technology
The microSSD cuts defect rates from 1,000 DPPM to only 100
Longsys has introduced what it calls the industry’s first integrated-packaging microSSD, or mSSD, using a design which merges several key components into a single compact package.
The mSSD measures just 20 x 30mm and is only 2mm thick, weighing just 2.2 grams.
Despite its size, it supports PCIe Gen4x4 performance, reaching sequential read speeds of up to 7400MB/s and write speeds of up to 6500MB/s.

Integrated chip packaging
This device achieves random read and write figures of up to 1000K and 820K IOPS, respectively, keeping performance in line with larger M.2 drives.
Unlike traditional
SSDs
that rely on PCB assembly, the mSSD uses wafer-level System-in-Package (SiP) technology.
This approach integrates the controller, NAND flash, power management IC, and other passive components within one enclosure.
This eliminates nearly 1,000 solder joints typically found in PCB-based SSDs.</div>

Tesla reported a profitable third quarter today — its first this year — as shoppers scrambled to snatch up the company’s EVs
in record numbers
before the federal EV tax credit expired.
Tesla said it earned $1.4 billion in net income on $28.1 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended in September. That’s 12 percent increase in revenue but a 37 percent decrease in profits over the third quarter of 2024, when the company earned $2.2 billion in net income on $25.2 billion in revenue. Tesla’s revenue came in above Wall Street expectations of $26.24 billion,

Apple has removed dating apps Tea and TeaOnHer from the App Store for violating rules related to content moderation and user privacy. The company told
TechCrunch
that it pulled the apps as they broke several of its
rules
, including one mandating that apps can&#x27;t share or otherwise use an individual&#x27;s personal info without getting their permission first.
Apple said they also violated a rule concerning user-generated content, which stipulates that apps need to allow for reporting offensive or concerning material, an option to block abusive users and the ability to filter &quot;objectionable material from being posted.&quot; In addition, Apple claimed the apps broke rules related to user reviews. It told
TechCrunch
they had an &quot;excessive&quot; volume of negative reviews and complaints from users, including ones related to minors’ personal details being shared. The company noted that it raised these issues&#x27; with the apps&#x27; developers, but they were not resolved.
As it stands, both apps are still available on Android through the Google Play Store. Tea (which is formally called Tea Dating Advice) enables women to post details about men they&#x27;ve met or dated. It allows them to post and comment on photos, look up public records on individuals, carry out reverse image searches, share their experiences and rate or review men. Users can, for instance, say whether they&#x27;d give a man a &quot;green flag&quot; or a &quot;red flag.&quot;

OpenAI’s ‘embarrassing’ math
“Hoisted by their own GPTards.”
That’s how Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun
described
the blowback after OpenAI researchers did a victory lap over GPT-5’s supposed math breakthroughs.
Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis
added
, “this is embarrassing.”
The Decoder
reports
that in a since-deleted tweet, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil declared that “GPT-5 found solutions to 10 (!) previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 others.” (“Erdős problems” are
famous conjectures
posed by mathematician Paul Erdős.)
However, mathematician Thomas Bloom, who maintains
the Erdos Problems website
, said Weil’s post was
“a dramatic misrepresentation”
— while these problems were indeed listed as “open” on Bloom’s website, he said that only means, “I personally am unaware of a paper which solves it.”
In other words, it’s not accurate to claim GPT-5 was able to solve previously unsolved problems. Instead, Bloom wrote, “GPT-5 found references, which solved these problems, that I personally was unaware of.”
Sebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher who’d also been touting GPT-5’s accomplishments, then
acknowledged
that “only solutions in the literature were found,” but he suggested this remains a real accomplishment: “I know how hard it is to search the literature.”

The teacher is the new engineer: Inside the rise of AI enablement and PromptOps

As more companies quickly begin using gen AI, it’s important to avoid a big mistake that could impact its effectiveness: Proper onboarding. Companies spend time and money training new human workers to succeed, but when they use large language model (LLM) helpers, many treat them like simple tools that need no explanation.
This isn&#x27;t just a waste of resources; it&#x27;s risky. Research shows that AI has advanced quickly from testing to actual use in 2024 to 2025, with
almost a third of companies
reporting a sharp increase in usage and acceptance from the previous year.
Probabilistic systems need governance, not wishful thinking
Unlike traditional software, gen AI is
probabilistic and adaptive
. It learns from interaction, can drift as data or usage changes and operates in the gray zone between automation and agency. Treating it like static software ignores reality: Without monitoring and updates, models degrade and produce faulty outputs: A phenomenon widely known as
model drift
. Gen AI also lacks built-in
organizational intelligence. A model trained on internet data may write a Shakespearean sonnet, but it won’t know your escalation paths and compliance constraints unless you teach it. Regulators and standards bodies have begun pushing guidance precisely because these systems behave dynamically and can
hallucinate, mislead or leak data
if left unchecked.
The real-world costs of skipping onboarding
When LLMs hallucinate, misinterpret tone, leak sensitive information or amplify bias, the costs are tangible.
Misinformation and liability:
A Canadian tribunal
held Air Canada liable after
its website chatbot gave a passenger incorrect policy information. The ruling made it clear that companies remain responsible for their AI agents’ statements.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed Sunday that it is investigating an airliner that was struck by an object in its windscreen, mid-flight, over Utah.
“NTSB gathering radar, weather, flight recorder data,” the federal agency said on the
social media site X
. “Windscreen being sent to NTSB laboratories for examination.”
The strike occurred Thursday, during a United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles.
Images shared on social media
showed that one of the two large windows at the front of a 737 MAX aircraft was significantly cracked. Related images also reveal a pilot’s arm that has been cut multiple times by what appear to be small shards of glass.
Object’s origin not confirmed
The captain of the flight
reportedly
described the object that hit the plane as “space debris.” This has not been confirmed, however.

After the impact, the aircraft safely landed at Salt Lake City International Airport after being diverted.
Images of the strike showed that an object made a forceful impact near the upper right part of the window, showing damage to the metal frame. Because aircraft windows are multiple layers thick, with laminate in between, the window pane did not shatter completely. The aircraft was flying above 30,000 feet—likely around 36,000 feet—and the cockpit apparently maintained its cabin pressure.
So was it space debris? It is impossible to know without more data. A very few species of birds can fly above 30,000 feet.</div>

Oracle claims its Zettascale10 system can hit 16 zettaFLOPS peak
The project uses around 800,000 Nvidia GPUs spread across data centers
OpenAI’s Stargate cluster in Texas runs on Oracle’s new infrastructure
Oracle has announced what it calls the largest AI supercomputer in the cloud, the OCI
Zettascale10
.
The company claims the system can deliver 16 zettaFLOPS of peak performance across 800,000
Nvidia
GPUs.
That output, when divided, equals about 20 petaflops per GPU, roughly matching the Grace Blackwell GB300 Ultra chip used in high-end desktop AI systems.
