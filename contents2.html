The latest exchange began with Altman posting screenshots about his attempt to cancel a 2018 Tesla Roadster reservation and get a refund, citing a 7.5-year delay. Musk responded by accusing Altman of stealing a nonprofit, referencing past criticisms, lawsuits, and takeover bids related to OpenAI&#x27;s restructuring. Musk also started a rival AI startup, xAI, and is suing OpenAI and Apple for alleged collusion. Furthermore, Musk claimed Altman&#x27;s screenshots were incomplete, stating the refund issue was resolved within 24 hours.</div>

                <div class="summary">A recent research article by Apple, &quot;The Illusion of Thinking,&quot; argues that large reasoning models (LRMs) cannot think and only perform pattern-matching, citing their inability to carry out calculations with predefined algorithms as problems grow. This article counters that argument, stating it&#x27;s flawed because humans also fail at complex algorithmic tasks like the Tower of Hanoi with many discs. The author claims that LRMs almost certainly can think, defining thinking in relation to problem-solving, which involves problem representation (frontal and parietal lobes), working memory, attention, executive functions, and encoding symbolic structures.</div>

                <div class="summary">Social network Bluesky, which on Friday announced a new
milestone of 40 million users
, will soon start testing “dislikes” as a way to improve personalization on its main Discover feed and others.
The news was shared alongside a host of other
conversation control updates and changes
, which include smaller tweaks to replies, improved detection of toxic comments, and other ways to prioritize more relevant conversations to the individual user.
With the “dislikes” beta rolling out soon, Bluesky will take into account the new signal to improve user personalization. As users “dislike” posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked feeds, but also reply rankings.
The company explained the changes are designed to make Bluesky a place for more “fun, genuine, and respectful exchanges” — an edict that follows a month of unrest on the platform as some users
again criticized the platform over its moderation decisions
. While Bluesky is designed as a decentralized network where users run their own moderation, some subset of Bluesky users want the platform itself to ban bad actors and
controversial figures
instead of leaving it up to the users to block them.
Bluesky, however, wants to focus more on the tools it provides users to control their own experience.
Today, this includes things like moderation lists that let users quickly block a group of people they don’t want to interact with, content filter controls, muted words, and the ability to subscribe to other moderation service providers. Bluesky also lets users detach quote posts to limit unwanted attention, which has long influenced the toxic culture of “
dunking
” on X (formerly Twitter).
In addition to dislikes, the company says it’s testing a mix of ranking updates, design changes, and other feedback tools to improve the conversations ...</div>

Inside Celosphere 2025: Why there’s no ‘enterprise AI’ without process intelligence
VB Staff
October 31, 2025
Presented by Celonis
AI adoption is accelerating, but results often lag expectations. And enterprise leaders are under pressure to prove measurable ROI from the AI solutions — especially as the use of autonomous agents rises and global tariffs disrupt supply chains.
The issue isn’t the AI itself, says Alex Rinke, co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, a global leader in process intelligence. “To succeed, enterprise AI needs to understand the context of a business’s processes — and how to improve them,” he explains. Without this business context, AI risks becoming, as Rinke puts it, “just an internal social experiment.”
Next week’s
Celosphere 2025
will tackle the AI ROI challenge head-on. The three-day event brings together customer strategies, hands-on workshops, and live demonstrations, highlighting enhancements to the Celonis Process Intelligence (PI) Platform that help enterprises harness ‘enterprise AI,’ powered by PI, to continuously improve operations, creating measurable business value at scale.
Focus on measurable ROI
The event’s focus on achieving AI ROI reflects three challenges facing technology and business leaders moving from pilot to production: obsolete systems, break-neck industry change, and agentic AI.
According to Gartner
, 64% of board members now view AI as a top-three priority — yet only 10% of organizations report meaningful financial returns.
Celonis customers are bucking that trend. A
Forrester Total Economic Impact study
found organizations using its platform achieved 383% ROI over three years, with payback in just six months. One company improved sales order automation from 33% to 86%, saving $24.5 million. The study estimated $44.1 million in total benefits over three years, driven by faster automation, reduced inefficien...</div>

The road to the second flight of Blue Origin’s heavy-lifting New Glenn rocket got a lot clearer Thursday night with a success test-firing of the launcher’s seven main engines on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.
Standing on a seaside launch pad, the New Glenn rocket ignited its seven BE-4 main engines at 9:59 pm EDT Thursday (01:59 UTC Friday). The engines burned for 38 seconds while the rocket remained firmly on the ground, according to a
social media post
by Blue Origin.
The hold-down firing of the first stage engines was the final major test of the New Glenn rocket before launch day. Blue Origin previously test-fired the rocket’s second-stage engines. Officials have not announced a target launch date, but sources tell Ars the rocket could be ready for liftoff as soon as November 9.
“Love seeing New Glenn’s seven BE-4 engines come alive! Congratulations to Team Blue on today’s hotfire,” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp,
posted on X
.
Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, said the engines operated at full power for 22 seconds, generating nearly 3.9 million pounds of thrust. Limp said engineers extended this test-firing and shut down some of the BE-4 engines to simulate the booster’s landing burn sequence, which Blue Origi...</div>

Robin Hood wasn&#x27;t what I expected, and that&#x27;s both a good and bad thing. While taking Rob&#x27;s story in a new direction feels refreshing and enriching, there&#x27;s a lot of shock-factor tacked on for no good reason.
Pros
+
Robin Hood&#x27;s new story feels like something we&#x27;ve not seen before
+
Leads Jack Patten and Lauren McQueen are impressive for newbies
+
My favorite Connie Nielsen role since Gladiator
+
Every episode cliffhanger is a knockout
+
Gets many of the core storytelling basics down pat
Cons
-
Production quality bounces between high and low-end
-
Far too many gratuitous sex scenes
-
Some episodes feel like obvious filler
-

Don&#x27;t tell
Amazon
, but my heart sank when I first heard that yet another
Robin Hood
adaptation was coming to
MGM+
. But after watching it, I&#x27;ve mostly been won over. As it turns out, you can teach an old dog new tricks.
I&#x27;ve always been of the firm belief that the 2010
Robin Hood
movie starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett is the best we&#x27;ve had (I didn&#x27;t grow up watching the animated
Disney movie
from 1973, so I&#x27;m discounting that). However, newcomer Jack Patten in the titular role and Lauren McQueen as Marian are a breath of fresh air.
Straight off the bat, the new series has taken a huge risk by putting two unknown actors in its lead roles, and this is a large part of why I think the 10-episode series is so successful. They&#x27;re perfectly counterbalanced by heavyweights Sean Bean (Sheriff ...</div>
