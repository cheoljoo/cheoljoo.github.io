                <div class="summary">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 will feature a panel discussion on the evolving landscape of developer tools and their impact on early product development, particularly concerning the hiring of “first critical engineers.” The panel, including experts from Bessemer Venture Partners, Sentry, and Warp, will explore what founders truly need from early engineering hires, the capabilities and limitations of AI-enabled tooling, and how the go-to-market and product lifecycle are adapting to new development paradigms. The discussion aims to delve into the practical aspects of modern startup building, addressing whether “vibe coding” is a fleeting trend or a new reality. The event, taking place October 27–29 in San Francisco, will gather over 10,000 startup founders, VCs, and tech innovators. Attendees are encouraged to secure passes by September 26 to save up to $668.</div>

                <div class="summary">A rapidly escalating Ebola outbreak in a southwestern province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing severe funding shortages, with health responders possessing less than a tenth of the $25 million needed to contain the deadly disease. The outbreak began with a 34-year-old pregnant woman who died on August 25, and by September 4, 28 cases and 15 deaths were reported. As of this week, there are at least 57 cases and 35 deaths, marking a 61% fatality rate, according to the WHO. Officials are struggling to respond due to poor road networks and overwhelmed health facilities that lack critical resources like clean water and protective equipment. The only treatment center in the Bulape health zone is operating at 119% capacity.</div>

                <div class="summary">Recent research from The Adaptavist Group highlights a significant divide in AI adoption within workplaces, categorizing leaders into “skeptics” and “realists.” 42% of leaders are identified as skeptics, believing their company&#x27;s AI claims are exaggerated and expressing concerns about financial, psychological, and physical risks to customers. Nearly half of skeptics fear being wrongly accused of AI misuse, with 42% hiding their AI usage. In contrast, 36% are realists who are confident in AI&#x27;s realistic expectations and report clear benefits such as improved work quality and time efficiency, experiencing much lower anxiety levels. This suggests a varied confidence level in AI tools among leaders.</div>

                <div class="summary">Apple has reportedly developed an internal ChatGPT-inspired application, codenamed “Veritas,” to test and refine the new capabilities of Siri ahead of its anticipated updated release next year. This move, reported by Bloomberg, indicates Apple&#x27;s efforts to advance Siri beyond its current limitations, especially after publicly delaying its update in March 2025. The app allows Apple employees to test Siri&#x27;s ability to search personal data (like emails and messages) and perform actions within apps (like photo editing), while also gathering feedback on the value of a chatbot format. This development suggests the Siri update project is in a more advanced stage, aiming to deliver a more context-aware and capable voice assistant that can interact with a user&#x27;s life data, a vision Apple initially promised at WWDC 2024.</div>

                <div class="summary">Microsoft has cut off the Israel Ministry of Defense’s access to some of its tech and services after an internal investigation found the organization appeared to be using its tech to store surveillance data on phone calls made by Palestinians.
The tech giant announced on Thursday that it made the decision to “cease and disable” certain subscriptions from the Israeli military. This affects subscriptions to Azure cloud storage and certain AI services.
“We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,” Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a
blog post
. “We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft’s standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians.”
Microsoft informed Israel of its decision last week, according to
The Guardian
.
The decision follows Microsoft’s ongoing review of the matter, which started in August. The investigation was sparked by a story in
The Guardian
that reported that Unit 8200, the elite Israel military intelligence unit, was using Azure cloud storage to house data on phone calls obtained through the surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
In his blog post, Smith also said the company appreciated The Guardian’s initial reporting. Smith wrote that without it, they wouldn’t have known to look into the matter, as due to customer privacy rights, they can’t access a customer’s content.
“As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust,” Smith wrote.

Study: Planned budget cuts would hurt drug development badly
Drug patents frequently cite research that the NIH wouldn&#x27;t be able to fund.

The proposed federal budget
would see drastic cuts
made to most of the agencies that fund science. The sheer magnitude of the cuts—including a 40 percent slashing of money going to the National Institutes of Health—would do severe harm to biomedical researchers and the industries that serve or rely on them. And, ultimately, that is likely to do harm to all of us.
In today&#x27;s issue of Science, some researchers have attempted to put numbers on those indirect effects that fall within that &quot;ultimately&quot; category. They&#x27;ve identified which grants wouldn&#x27;t have been funded had similar cuts been made earlier in this century and tracked the impact that likely had on drug patents. Their conclusion: Development of roughly half the newly approved drugs relied on work that was funded by a grant that would need to be cut.
From grants to drugs
It&#x27;s uncertain whether the proposed budget cuts will go through. At the moment, Congress is
looking to fund most science agencies
at levels similar to their current budgets. Should cuts eventually happen, then it&#x27;s also difficult to predict how they&#x27;ll be spread among the more than 20 institutes that make up the NIH (a number that the administration also wants to see reduced via consolidation). So, the researchers make a big simplifying assumption: Every institute within the NIH will take a 40 percent hit to its budget.
From there, it actually becomes simple to identify the grants that would be dropped as a result of these budget cuts. That&#x27;s because the NIH operates a system in which each grant submission gets a priority score after evaluation and discussion. Grants are then f...</div>

Report warns attackers can intercept API calls on iOS devices, and make them appear legitimate
Traditional security tools fail to protect apps against in-device attacks
Compromised mobile devices significantly increase the risk of API exploitation
New research from
Zimperium
has claimed mobile apps are now the primary battleground for API-based attacks, creating serious risks of fraud and data theft for enterprises.
The research shows 1 in 3 Android apps and more than half of iOS apps leak sensitive data, offering attackers direct access to business-critical systems.
Even more worrying the report claims three of every 1,000 mobile devices arealready infected, with 1 in 5 Android devices encountering malware in the wild.

The scale of mobile API vulnerabilities
Unlike web applications, mobile apps ship API endpoints and calling logic onto untrusted devices, exposing them to potential tampering and reverse-engineering.
This allows attackers to intercept traffic, modify the app, and make malicious API calls appear legitimate.
Traditional defenses such as
firewalls
, gateways, proxies, and API key validation cannot fully protect against these in-app threats.
“APIs don’t just power mobile apps, they expose them,” said Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product solutions at Zimperium.

Microsoft is making advances with a new way to cool microchips that it says could lead to more energy-efficient data centers in the future. It’s a method called microfluidics that involves liquid coolant flowing directly into the silicon.
After lab tests, Microsoft found that this strategy can remove heat up to three times better than cold plates currently used in data centers today. The company announced this week tha...</div>

Google asks Supreme Court to rescue it from its Epic lawsuit
The court previously turned down Apple when it made a similar request in 2024.

Google is asking the Supreme Court to step in and pause the ruling the company received in its lawsuit with Epic Games, according to
a filing
the company shared with Engadget. The company is making its request following
a major legal loss to Epic Games
in October 2024, which required it to open the Google Play Store to third-party app stores for a period of three years.
Google is asking the justices to intervene by October 17, three days before the injunction Epic won starts to go into effect. The company hopes that after offering a stay, the Court will take up the case for a full review. Asking the Supreme Court for relief wouldn&#x27;t have even entered the picture if Google&#x27;s appeal hadn&#x27;t already been
denied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
. The company&#x27;s filing includes multiple technical reasons why the Ninth Circuit Court&#x27;s ruling should be overturned. It also offers several examples why the original injunction Epic won is bad for Google, developers and consumers.
Google believes the injunction &quot;[creates] enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive or pirated content to proliferate,” and that it burdens developers with &quot;constantly monitoring dozens or hundreds of stores that might suddenly carry their apps without their knowledge.&quot; The company also notes that the injunction will make it &quot;substantially easier for developers to avoid compensating Google,&quot; for Play Store services that have nothing to do with payments.
