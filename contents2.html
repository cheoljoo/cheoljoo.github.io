, we’ve explored how founders should approach marketing, but this week we’re exploring how VCs sell themselves to founders as trustworthy partners, and to LPs as worthwhile investments. Isabelle Johannessen spoke with Graham &amp; Walker’s Leslie Feinzaig and XYZ Venture’s Ross Fubini about raising their first funds and how that experience has given them empathy for the founder fundraising experience. Feinzaig came into venture capital with very few industry connections.”It was hundreds of pitches. It was raised almost entirely from individuals. We ended up with 105 LPs,” she said. “If you don’t have a track record, then what they’re investing in is in you. Like it is basically, like, raising a gigantic angel round with no lead.”
With that outsider perspective she’s been able to position herself as the call founders make before they meet with their board to practice and discuss strategy. Similarly, Fubini encourages the leadership teams he works with to carefully consider who they are entering into partnership with. His rubric follows three core tenets: person, firm, terms. “You work with this person for forever. So it’s everything from like, are they fun? Do you trust them? Do they have the juice to get the deal done? It’s everything around this human,” he said. Techcrunch event

OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 is here: what enterprises need to know

The rumors were true: OpenAI on Thursday announced the release of its new frontier large language model (LLM) family,
GPT-5.2
. It comes at a pivotal moment for the AI pioneer, which has faced intensifying pressure since rival
Google’s Gemini 3 LLM seized the top spot
on major third-party performance leaderboards and many key benchmarks last month, though OpenAI leaders stressed in a press briefing that the timing of this release had been discussed and worked on well in advance of the release of Gemini 3. OpenAI describes GPT-5.2 as its &quot;most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work,&quot; aiming to reclaim the performance crown with significant gains in reasoning, coding, and agentic workflows. &quot;It’s our most advanced frontier model and the strongest yet in the market for professional use,&quot; Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, said during a press briefing today. &quot;We designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people. It&#x27;s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects.&quot;
GPT-5.2 features a massive 400,000-token context window — allowing it to ingest hundreds of documents or large code repositories at once — and a 128,000 max output token limit, enabling it to generate extensive reports or full applications in a single go. The model also features a knowledge cutoff of August 31, 2025, ensuring it is up-to-date with relatively recent world events and technical documentation. It explicitly includes &quot;Reasoning token support,&quot; confirming the underlying architecture uses the chain-of-thought processing popularized by the &quot;o1&quot; series.</div>

Disney says Google AI infringes copyright “on a massive scale”

The Wild West of copyrighted characters in AI may be coming to an end. There has been legal wrangling over the role of copyright in the AI era, but the mother of all legal teams may now be gearing up for a fight. Disney has sent a cease and desist to Google, alleging the company’s AI tools are infringing Disney’s copyrights “on a massive scale.”
According to the letter
, Google is violating the entertainment conglomerate’s intellectual property in multiple ways. The legal notice says Google has copied a “large corpus” of Disney’s works to train its gen AI models, which is believable, as Google’s image and video models will happily produce popular Disney characters—they couldn’t do that without feeding the models lots of Disney data. The C&amp;D also takes issue with Google for distributing “copies of its protected works” to consumers. So all those memes you’ve been making with Disney characters? Yeah, Disney doesn’t like that, either. The letter calls out a huge number of Disney-owned properties that can be prompted into existence in Google AI, including The Lion King, Deadpool, and Star Wars. The company calls on Google to immediately stop using Disney content in its AI tools and create measures to ensure that future AI outputs don’t produce any characters that Disney owns. Disney is famously litigious and has an army of lawyers dedicated to defending its copyrights. The nature of copyright law in the US is a direct result of Disney’s legal maneuvering, which has extended its control of iconic characters by decades.</div>

OpenAI warns future LLMs could aid zero‑day development or advanced cyber‑espionage

New Frontier Risk Council will guide safeguards and responsible capability across frontier models
Future OpenAI Large Language Models (LLM) could pose higher cybersecurity risks as, in theory, they could be able to develop working zero-day remote exploits against well-defended systems, or meaningfully assist with complex and stealthy cyber-espionage campaigns. This is according to OpenAI itself who, in a recent blog, said that cyber capabilities in its
AI models
are “advancing rapidly”. While this might sound sinister, OpenAI is actually viewing this from a positive perspective, saying that the advancements also bring “meaningful benefits for cyberdefense”. You may like

players on Android devices in the US can once again download the game directly from the
Google Play Store
, not long after it
returned to Apple’s App Store in May
. Its return comes five years after it was
removed from Google’s app store
as Epic Games pushed back against Apple and Google’s app store policies, forcing players to manually sideload it on Android devices. An
Epic tweet
confirming
Fortnite
’s return to Google’s app store said it is the result of “Google’s compliance with the U.S. District Court’s injunction,” referring to the
ongoing legal battle and proposed settlement.</div>

New York passes law requiring ads to disclose the use of AI performers
A bill focused on how someone&#x27;s name or likeness can be used after their death was also passed. Ian Carlos Campbell

New York is taking steps to regulate the use of AI in the state&#x27;s entertainment industry. NY State Governor Kathy Hochul
passed two pieces of legislation
on Thursday that forces certain productions to disclose the use of AI-generated performers, and defines rules around how someone&#x27;s likeness can be used after their death. Assembly Bill A8887B, now known as S.8420-A, specifically covers the use of AI performers in advertisements. Per Hochul&#x27;s announcement, the law &quot;requires persons who produce or create an advertisement to identify if it includes AI generated synthetic performers.&quot; S.8391, meanwhile, &quot;requires consent from heirs or executors if a person wishes to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death.&quot;
“By signing these bills today, we are enacting common sense laws that will ensure we are fully transparent when using images generated by artificial intelligence and also prevent the unauthorized commercial use of a deceased individual’s name or likeness,&quot; Governor Hochul said in the announcement. &quot;In New York State, we are setting a clear standard that keeps pace with technology, while protecting artists and consumers long after the credits roll.&quot;

The use of AI performers and deepfakes made using the likenesses of actors were major focuses of the contract SAG-AFTRA won during its
strike in 2023
. The union ultimately agreed to allow for the use of things like digital replicas and AI-generated performers, with
some key carveouts
. For example, actors have to give their explicit consent for a digital replica to be made in their image.</div>
