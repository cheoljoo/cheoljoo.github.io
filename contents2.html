                <div class="summary">AI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past twelve months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”
The dictionary
defines the term
as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”
“Like
slime
,
sludge
, and
muck
,
slop
has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology. “It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”
The word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like
OpenAI’s Sora
and
Google Gemini’s Veo
are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials—even entire movies. One study in May
claimed that
nearly 75 percent of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI. These new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content
can be milked for advertising money
. Critics
worry that
this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them up into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which—as you might imagine—can be quite light on informational value.</div>

We&#x27;ve heard (and written, here at VentureBeat) lots about the generative AI race
between the U.S. and China
, as those have been the countries with the groups most active in fielding new models (with a shoutout to Cohere in Canada and Mistral in France). But now a Korean startup is making waves: last week, the firm known as
Motif Technologies
released
Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning
, another small parameter open-weight model that boasts impressive benchmark scores, quickly becoming the most performant model from that country according to
independent benchmarking lab Artificial Analysis
(beating even regular GPT-5.1 from U.S. leader OpenAI). But more importantly for enterprise AI teams, the company has
published a white paper on arxiv.org
with a concrete, reproducible training recipe that exposes where reasoning performance actually comes from — and where common internal LLM efforts tend to fail. For organizations building or fine-tuning their own models behind the firewall, the paper offers a set of practical lessons about data alignment, long-context infrastructure, and reinforcement learning stability that are directly applicable to enterprise environments. Here they are:
1. Reasoning gains come from data distribution, not model size
One of Motif’s most relevant findings for enterprise teams is that
synthetic reasoning data
only helps when its structure
matches
the
target model’s reasoning style
. The paper shows measurable differences in downstream coding performance depending on which “teacher” model generated the reasoning traces used during supervised fine-tuning. For enterprises, this undermines a common shortcut: generating large volumes of synthetic chain-of-thought data from a frontier model and assuming it will transfer cleanly.</div>

Last month saw
the release of Project Misriah
, an ambitious modding project that tried to recreate the feel of
Halo 3
inside Valve’s
Counter-Strike 2
. That project has now been taken down from the Steam Workshop, though, after drawing a DMCA complaint from Microsoft. Modder Froddoyo
introduced Project Misriah on November 16
as “a workshop collection of
Halo
ported maps and assets that aims to bring a
Halo 3
multiplayer-like experience to
Counter-Strike 2
.” Far from just being inspired by
Halo 3
, the mod directly copied multiple sound effects, character models, maps, and even movement mechanics from Bungie and Microsoft’s popular series. In the weeks since, Project Misriah drew a lot of praise from both
Halo
fans and those impressed by what modders could pull off with the Source 2 engine. But last Wednesday, modder Froddoyo
shared a DMCA request from Microsoft
citing the “unauthorized use of
Halo
game content in a [Steam] workshop not associated with
Halo
games.”
A trailer announcing Project Misriah, posted last month. In a social media post sharing that DMCA text, Froddoyo ruefully said that players should “make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft” for the project’s fate. But in
a comment on Project Misriah’s YouTube trailer
, Froddoyo noted that, following the takedown, the project “will not be worked on or uploaded in the future.</div>

Samsung PM9E1 delivers PCIe Gen5 performance within an unusually small 22 x 42mm footprint
Double-sided component placement enables high capacity despite severe physical space constraints
Specialized PCB materials help mitigate mechanical stress during prolonged thermal cycling
Samsung
’s
PM9E1 NVMe Gen5 SSD emerged quietly in 2024
, surprising the industry as the company
entered mass production
without a major announcement. This model followed the PM9A1 SSD launched in 2021, introducing improvements in speed, capacity, and power efficiency. The drive measures only 22 by 42 millimeters, a significant reduction compared with previous M.2 2280 designs, yet it integrates a full
SSD
architecture optimized for high-performance workloads. You may like

Is this the next Minidisc? Exciting Mini SSD format could suffer fate of Sony&#x27;s data format if it doesn&#x27;t get further backing
Technical challenges and thermal management
Engineers employed a double-sided layout, mounting NAND, DRAM, and power management components on both sides of the compact PCB to achieve capacities of up to 4TB. Integrating all essential components into such a small form factor required careful thermal management and mechanical reliability considerations.</div>

is a commerce writer covering deals and buying guides. Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire. Sony’s annual PlayStation sale has been going on for nearly a month now, offering discounts on everything from the
PlayStation 5 Digital Edition
and
PlayStation Portal
to Sony’s standard
DualSense controller
. However, the end of the sale is quickly approaching, with Sony’s website showing that some deals are set to expire as soon as Friday, December 19th, while others have a little more runway through December 28th. That means you don’t have much longer to sneak in a last-minute gift for yourself or someone you love.</div>

Bungie&#x27;s Marathon will arrive on PS5 and PC in March
Sony released a 23-minute video showing an updated look and new features. Kris Holt

Bungie’s
Marathon
has a new release window. The survival extraction shooter was originally set to hit PlayStation 5 and PC
in September
, but by June, Sony had
delayed it indefinitely
. Now, with a plagiarism issue largely in the rearview mirror, Bungie has
confirmed
that
Marathon
will arrive in March and and plans to sell it for $40. Alongside the release date and price announcement, Bungie released a 23-minute video that takes a deep dive into the game and shows off the current state of
Marathon. New features include proximity chat and a solo mode, while Bungie says it has upgraded the environmental storytelling and visual fidelity. Gritty environments provide a nice contrast to the glossy sci-fi sheen that defined
Marathon
’s visual language in our
earliest looks at the game
. There’s a lot more on deck for
Marathon
’s first year including new maps and events. Bungie also plans to release more shells, which are akin to character classes that can be customized by changing your loadout. The Rook shell, for instance, is a new one that the studio has added since the alpha playtests. This shell allows you to join a run that&#x27;s already in progress. You’ll have a limited loadout, but you’re not really risking anything valuable as you run around to loot items. Advertisement

There’s a lot riding on
Marathon
. Parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment said last month that
Destiny 2
had
not lived up to its expectations
and it wrote down the value of Bungie’s assets by $204 million. Back in August, Sony asserted more control over Bungie and said the developer was “shifting into a role that is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios.”
That’s hardly the only issue Bungie has faced this year.</div>
