Beware coworkers who produce AI-generated ‘workslop’
Researchers at consulting firm
BetterUp Labs
, in collaboration with Stanford Social Media Lab, have coined a new term to describe low-quality, AI-generated work: “workslop.”
As defined in an article
published this week in the Harvard Business Review
, workslop is “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.”
BetterUp Labs researchers suggest that workslop could be one explanation for the 95% of organizations that have tried AI but report
seeing zero return on that investment
. Workslop, they write, can be “unhelpful, incomplete, or missing crucial context,” which just creates more work for everyone else.
“The insidious effect of workslop is that it shifts the burden of the work downstream, requiring the receiver to interpret, correct, or redo the work,” they write.
The researchers also conducted an
ongoing survey
of 1,150 full-time, U.S.-based employees, with 40% of respondents saying they’d received workslop in the past month.
To avoid this, the researchers say workplace leaders must “model thoughtful AI use that has purpose and intention” and “set clear guardrails for your teams around norms and acceptable use.”

We’re about a quarter of the way through the 21st century.
Summers across the global north are now defined by flash floods, droughts, heat waves, uncontainable wildfires, and intensifying named storms, exactly as predicted by Exxon scientists back in the 1970s. The United States secretary of health and human services advocates against using the most effective tool we have to fight the infectious diseases that have ravaged humanity for millennia. People are eagerly lapping up the misinformation spewed and disseminated by AI chatbots, which are only just getting started.
It is against this backdrop that a climate scientist and a vaccine developer teamed up to write
Science Under Siege
. It is about as grim as you’d expect.
Science Under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces That Threaten Our World
By Michael E. Mann and Peter J. Hotez
Michael Mann is a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who, in 1998, developed the notorious hockey stick graph, which demonstrated that global surface temperatures were roughly flat until around the year 1900, when they started rising precipitously (and have not stopped). Peter Hotez is a microbiologist and pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine whose group developed a low-cost, patent-free COVID-19 vaccine using public funds (i.e., not from a pharmaceutical company) and distributed it to almost a hundred million people in India and Indonesia.</div>

GL.iNet Comet Pro Remote KVM supports 4K video passthrough with responsive interaction at a distance
The device allows powering on a PC remotely using accessories
Remote 4K video passthrough keeps interaction smooth at 30 frames
GL.iNet, the company behind the
Comet (GL-RM1)
, an open source remote KVM running a Linux distribution, has launched the Comet Pro Remote KVM, a device which allows full control of computers,
workstations
, or servers entirely over Wi-Fi.
The crowdfunding for this project has drawn attention on
Kickstarter
, with over 3,700 backers pledging more than $600,000, far ahead of its funding $10,000 goal.
This small device is designed to deliver what the company calls ultra-low latency performance and strong security.

Lenovo&#x27;s unknown Lecoo brand launches exciting mini PC which begs only one question to mind — when will it sell these outside of China?
Video performance and wireless connectivity
The idea is that anyone can troubleshoot, work, or manage systems without being physically present.
The Comet Pro promises smooth remote interaction by enabling
4K
passthrough at 30 frames per second.
The system relies on H.264 encoding to keep latency in the 30 to 60 millisecond range, making remote control very responsive.
Unlike traditional solutions that rely on wired connections, the device supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi 6 bands, reducing dependence on LAN cabling.</div>

Nintendo’s first-party
Switch 2 Pro Controller
can’t be beaten when it comes to its breadth of features and comfort. But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The

These are some recently released titles we think are worth adding to your reading list. Get lost in Bitter Karella&#x27;s splatterpunk, cosmic fever dream,
Moonflow
, and the new zombie apocalypse comic,
Everything Dead &amp; Dying
.
Run For It
Moonflow
I am so glad the shockingly bright, fuzzy-blacklight-poster-style cover of this book grabbed my attention while I was doing work at a local cafe/bookstore the other day, because I otherwise might not have heard about
Moonflow
, and what a trip it turned out to be. Easily one of my favorite reads this year.
Moonflow
is, as author Bitter Karella described it in a recent
interview
, &quot;Psychedelic trans cosmic fungal splatterpunk.&quot; It follows Sarah, a trans woman who grows and sells trippy mushrooms, on a desperate search for a mushroom known as the King&#x27;s Breakfast. It&#x27;s the type of excursion that seems doomed from the start, as the King&#x27;s Breakfast is only found in a forest best known for being a place people do not return from, and predictably, things start going off the rails almost immediately. The forest is haunted and seemingly in a constant state of change, there&#x27;s a TERFy lesbian off-grid cult that&#x27;s engaged in some deeply bizarre activities and poor Sarah is… just doing her best (she is painfully relatable).
This book horrified me, made me laugh and made me gag, often all at once. It&#x27;s queer as hell, impressively creepy, packed with extremely on-the-nose satire and an absolutely wild ride all around.</div>

                <div class="summary">TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 will feature a panel discussion on the evolving landscape of developer tools and their impact on early product development, particularly concerning the hiring of “first critical engineers.” The panel, including experts from Bessemer Venture Partners, Sentry, and Warp, will explore what founders truly need from early engineering hires, the capabilities and limitations of AI-enabled tooling, and how the go-to-market and product lifecycle are adapting to new development paradigms. The discussion aims to delve into the practical aspects of modern startup building, addressing whether “vibe coding” is a fleeting trend or a new reality. The event, taking place October 27–29 in San Francisco, will gather over 10,000 startup founders, VCs, and tech innovators. Attendees are encouraged to secure passes by September 26 to save up to $668.</div>

                <div class="summary">A rapidly escalating Ebola outbreak in a southwestern province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing severe funding shortages, with health responders possessing less than a tenth of the $25 million needed to contain the deadly disease. The outbreak began with a 34-year-old pregnant woman who died on August 25, and by September 4, 28 cases and 15 deaths were reported. As of this week, there are at least 57 cases and 35 deaths, marking a 61% fatality rate, according to the WHO. Officials are struggling to respond due to poor road networks and overwhelmed health facilities that lack critical resources like clean water and protective equipment. The only treatment center in the Bulape health zone is operating at 119% capacity.</div>

                <div class="summary">Recent research from The Adaptavist Group highlights a significant divide in AI adoption within workplaces, categorizing leaders into “skeptics” and “realists.” 42% of leaders are identified as skeptics, believing their company&#x27;s AI claims are exaggerated and expressing concerns about financial, psychological, and physical risks to customers. Nearly half of skeptics fear being wrongly accused of AI misuse, with 42% hiding their AI usage. In contrast, 36% are realists who are confident in AI&#x27;s realistic expectations and report clear benefits such as improved work quality and time efficiency, experiencing much lower anxiety levels. This suggests a varied confidence level in AI tools among leaders.</div>

                <div class="summary">Apple has reportedly developed an internal ChatGPT-inspired application, codenamed “Veritas,” to test and refine the new capabilities of Siri ahead of its anticipated updated release next year. This move, reported by Bloomberg, indicates Apple&#x27;s efforts to advance Siri beyond its current limitations, especially after publicly delaying its update in March 2025. The app allows Apple employees to test Siri&#x27;s ability to search personal data (like emails and messages) and perform actions within apps (like photo editing), while also gathering feedback on the value of a chatbot format. This development suggests the Siri update project is in a more advanced stage, aiming to deliver a more context-aware and capable voice assistant that can interact with a user&#x27;s life data, a vision Apple initially promised at WWDC 2024.</div>
