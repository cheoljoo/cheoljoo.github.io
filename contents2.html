                <div class="summary">Apple and Google have released several software updates to protect against a hacking campaign targeting an unknown number of their users. On Wednesday, Google
released patches
for a handful of security bugs in its Chrome browser, noting that one of the bugs was being actively exploited by hackers before the company had time to patch it. Unusually for Google, the company provided no further details at the time. But on Friday, Google updated the page to say that the bug was discovered by Apple’s security engineering team and Google’s Threat Analysis Group, whose security researchers primarily track government hackers and
mercenary spyware
makers, indicating that the hacking campaign may have been orchestrated by government-backed hackers. At the same time, Apple released security updates for its flagship products, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Vision Pro, Apple TV, Apple Watches, and its Safari browser. According to
the security advisory for iPhones and iPads
, Apple patched two bugs that the company said it was aware “that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” running devices prior to iOS 26. That language is Apple’s typical way of saying that it knows some of its customers and users were targeted by hackers exploiting
zero-days
, meaning flaws that at the time of exploitation are unknown to the software makers. Often, these are cases where government hackers used hacking tools and spyware made by companies such as
NSO Group
or
Paragon Solutions
to target journalists, dissidents, and human rights activists. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Update today.</div>

OpenAI has officially
released GPT-5.2
, and the reactions from early testers — among whom OpenAI seeded the model several days prior to public release, in some cases weeks ago — paints a two toned picture: it is a monumental leap forward for deep, autonomous reasoning and coding, yet potentially an underwhelming &quot;incremental&quot; update for casual conversationalists. Following early access periods and today&#x27;s broader rollout, executives, developers, and analysts have taken to X (formerly Twitter) and company blogs to share their first testing results. Here is a roundup of the first reactions to OpenAI’s latest flagship model. &quot;AI as a serious analyst&quot;
The strongest praise for GPT-5.2 centers on its ability to handle &quot;hard problems&quot; that require extended thinking time. Matt Shumer, CEO of HyperWriteAI, did not mince words in
his review
, calling GPT-5.2 Pro &quot;the best model in the world.&quot;
Shumer highlighted the model&#x27;s tenacity, noting that &quot;it thinks for **over an hour** on hard problems. And it nails tasks no other model can touch.&quot;
This sentiment was
echoed by Allie K. Miller
, an AI entrepreneur and former AWS executive. Miller described the model as a step toward &quot;AI as a serious analyst&quot; rather than a &quot;friendly companion.&quot;
&quot;The thinking and problem-solving feel noticeably stronger,&quot; Miller wrote on X. &quot;It gives much deeper explanations than I’m used to seeing. At one point it literally wrote code to improve its own OCR in the middle of a task.&quot;
Enterprise gains: Box reports distinct performance jumps
For the enterprise sector, the update appears to be even more significant. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, revealed on X
that his company has been testing GPT-5.2 in early access.</div>

Dozens of Ukrainian civilians filed a
series of lawsuits
in Texas this week, accusing some of the biggest US chip firms of negligently failing to track chips that evaded export curbs. Those chips were ultimately used to power Russian and Iranian weapon systems, causing wrongful deaths last year. Their complaints alleged that for years, Texas Instruments (TI), AMD, and Intel have ignored public reporting, government warnings, and shareholder pressure to do more to track final destinations of chips and shut down shady distribution channels diverting chips to sanctioned actors in Russia and Iran. Putting profits over human lives, tech firms continued using “high-risk” channels, Ukrainian civilians’ legal team alleged in a
press statement
, without ever strengthening controls. All that intermediaries who placed bulk online orders had to do to satisfy chip firms was check a box confirming that the shipment wouldn’t be sent to sanctioned countries, lead attorney Mikal Watts told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday,
according to the Kyiv Independent
. “There are export lists,” Watts said. “We know exactly what requires a license and what doesn’t. And companies know who they’re selling to.</div>

Compact footprint with good connectivity, LDAC and aptX
Automatic S/PDIF and ADAT detection and mode switching
$199 / €199 (about £175 / AU$400)
&quot;Topping releases a new DAC&quot; isn&#x27;t really news: it makes loads of them, from the ultra-affordable D10s to the G5 portable headphone DAC/amp and premium D90 III Sabre. But the new E50 II is interesting because it&#x27;s an impressive Hi-Res Audio DAC that crams a lot into its desktop-friendly footprint. It&#x27;s cheap, too: $199 / €199 (about £175 / AU$400). That means it undercuts many of the
best headphone DACs
and comes in at a similar price to the rather good
iFi ZEN DAC 3
, although the two devices have key differences: the iFi is also a headphone amp, but lacks the Bluetooth capabilities of the Topping. (Image credit: Topping)
Topping E50 II: key features
The Topping E50 II is built around AKM&#x27;s AK4497S DAC, and over USB it&#x27;s capable of linear PCM up to 32-bit/768kHz and DSD up to DSD512 (DoP DSD up to DSD256). You may like

Despite the compact size, there&#x27;s plenty of connectivity here with USB-C, coaxial and optical S/PDIF. RCA and balanced sockets take care of the outputs. The digital interface is based on the XMOS XU316 and the digital inputs support both S/PDIF and ADAT (the latter on the optical input).</div>

iOS 26.2
for iPhone 11 and newer devices, which includes new Lock Screen customizations for you to adjust the opacity level, as well as the ability to use AirDrop with people who aren’t in your contacts by sharing a one-time code with them instead. There are also new updates going out for macOS, iPadOS, visionOS, and watchOS. On updated iPhones, the Reminders app now has an “urgent” option that will set an alarm for a task’s due time, while Apple Music added support for offline lyrics to go with downloaded songs, and a new Favorite Songs playlist inside top Picks. Live translation on AirPods is also finally coming to users in the EU after

IKEA&#x27;s
revamp of its smart home products
doesn&#x27;t end with Matter support. The furniture and home goods company also has a line of new Qi wireless chargers, the best of which, the
VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger
, combines the functionality of a PopSockets-style phone grip with cable storage. The $10 VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger is reminiscent of a bagel or donut, if you could take the top half of those ring-shaped foods and turn them inside out to create a cozy grip for your fingers. That same red silicone design also makes for a perfect place to store the charger&#x27;s built-in USB-C cable, according to IKEA&#x27;s product page, and otherwise acts as a playful replacement for what can be a pretty boring smartphone accessory.

VÄSTMÄRKE offers
Qi2 charging speeds
and can magnetically attach to iPhones with MagSafe or Pixel phones with
Google&#x27;s Pixelsnap magnets
. If you&#x27;re interested in something a bit more discrete, the $25
VÄSTMÄRKE wireless charger with lighting
is a bowl-shaped charger with a column in the center for attaching a smartphone, and room around it for keys or your wallet. Advertisement

IKEA has had multiple different ideas over the years for how smart home tech should integrate with its minimalist and user-friendly furniture. The company&#x27;s partnership with Sonos
ended in May 2025
, which produced lights and picture frames with smart speakers built-in.</div>

, we’ve explored how founders should approach marketing, but this week we’re exploring how VCs sell themselves to founders as trustworthy partners, and to LPs as worthwhile investments. Isabelle Johannessen spoke with Graham &amp; Walker’s Leslie Feinzaig and XYZ Venture’s Ross Fubini about raising their first funds and how that experience has given them empathy for the founder fundraising experience. Feinzaig came into venture capital with very few industry connections.”It was hundreds of pitches. It was raised almost entirely from individuals. We ended up with 105 LPs,” she said. “If you don’t have a track record, then what they’re investing in is in you. Like it is basically, like, raising a gigantic angel round with no lead.”
With that outsider perspective she’s been able to position herself as the call founders make before they meet with their board to practice and discuss strategy. Similarly, Fubini encourages the leadership teams he works with to carefully consider who they are entering into partnership with. His rubric follows three core tenets: person, firm, terms. “You work with this person for forever. So it’s everything from like, are they fun? Do you trust them? Do they have the juice to get the deal done? It’s everything around this human,” he said. Techcrunch event

OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 is here: what enterprises need to know

The rumors were true: OpenAI on Thursday announced the release of its new frontier large language model (LLM) family,
GPT-5.2
. It comes at a pivotal moment for the AI pioneer, which has faced intensifying pressure since rival
Google’s Gemini 3 LLM seized the top spot
on major third-party performance leaderboards and many key benchmarks last month, though OpenAI leaders stressed in a press briefing that the timing of this release had been discussed and worked on well in advance of the release of Gemini 3. OpenAI describes GPT-5.2 as its &quot;most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work,&quot; aiming to reclaim the performance crown with significant gains in reasoning, coding, and agentic workflows. &quot;It’s our most advanced frontier model and the strongest yet in the market for professional use,&quot; Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, said during a press briefing today. &quot;We designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people. It&#x27;s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects.&quot;
GPT-5.2 features a massive 400,000-token context window — allowing it to ingest hundreds of documents or large code repositories at once — and a 128,000 max output token limit, enabling it to generate extensive reports or full applications in a single go. The model also features a knowledge cutoff of August 31, 2025, ensuring it is up-to-date with relatively recent world events and technical documentation. It explicitly includes &quot;Reasoning token support,&quot; confirming the underlying architecture uses the chain-of-thought processing popularized by the &quot;o1&quot; series.</div>

The Wild West of copyrighted characters in AI may be coming to an end. There has been legal wrangling over the role of copyright in the AI era, but the mother of all legal teams may now be gearing up for a fight. Disney has sent a cease and desist to Google, alleging the company’s AI tools are infringing Disney’s copyrights “on a massive scale.”
According to the letter
, Google is violating the entertainment conglomerate’s intellectual property in multiple ways. The legal notice says Google has copied a “large corpus” of Disney’s works to train its gen AI models, which is believable, as Google’s image and video models will happily produce popular Disney characters—they couldn’t do that without feeding the models lots of Disney data. The C&amp;D also takes issue with Google for distributing “copies of its protected works” to consumers. So all those memes you’ve been making with Disney characters? Yeah, Disney doesn’t like that, either. The letter calls out a huge number of Disney-owned properties that can be prompted into existence in Google AI, including The Lion King, Deadpool, and Star Wars. The company calls on Google to immediately stop using Disney content in its AI tools and create measures to ensure that future AI outputs don’t produce any characters that Disney owns. Disney is famously litigious and has an army of lawyers dedicated to defending its copyrights. The nature of copyright law in the US is a direct result of Disney’s legal maneuvering, which has extended its control of iconic characters by decades.</div>

OpenAI warns future LLMs could aid zero‑day development or advanced cyber‑espionage
Company is investing in defensive tooling, access controls, and a tiered cybersecurity program
New Frontier Risk Council will guide safeguards and responsible capability across frontier models
Future OpenAI Large Language Models (LLM) could pose higher cybersecurity risks as, in theory, they could be able to develop working zero-day remote exploits against well-defended systems, or meaningfully assist with complex and stealthy cyber-espionage campaigns. This is according to OpenAI itself who, in a recent blog, said that cyber capabilities in its
AI models
are “advancing rapidly”. While this might sound sinister, OpenAI is actually viewing this from a positive perspective, saying that the advancements also bring “meaningful benefits for cyberdefense”. You may like
