                <div class="summary">January Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.
Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.
“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.”
This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.
“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.
Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”
Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21

OpenAI has
introduced GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max
, a new frontier agentic coding model now available in its Codex developer environment. The release marks a significant step forward in AI-assisted software engineering, offering improved long-horizon reasoning, efficiency, and real-time interactive capabilities. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will now replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model across Codex-integrated surfaces.
The new model is designed to serve as a persistent, high-context software development agent, capable of managing complex refactors, debugging workflows, and project-scale tasks across multiple context windows.
It comes on the heels of
Google releasing its powerful new Gemini 3 Pro model
yesterday, yet still outperforms or matches it on key coding benchmarks:
On
SWE-Bench Verified
,
GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieved 77.9% accuracy
at extra-high reasoning effort, edging past Gemini 3 Pro’s 76.2%.
It also led on
Terminal-Bench 2.0, with 58.1% accuracy versus Gemini’s 54.2%,
and matched Gemini’s score of 2,439 on LiveCodeBench Pro, a competitive coding Elo benchmark.
When measured against Gemini 3 Pro’s most advanced configuration — its Deep Thinking model — Codex-Max holds a slight edge in agentic coding benchmarks, as well.
Performance Benchmarks: Incremental Gains Across Key Tasks

On SWE-Lancer IC SWE, it achieved 79.9% accuracy, a significant increase from GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 66.3%. In SWE-Bench Verified (n=500), it reached 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, outperforming GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 73.7%.

On Monday, veteran game developer Rebecca Ann Heineman died in Rockwall, Texas, at age 62 after a battle with adenocarcinoma. Apogee founder Scott Miller first
shared
the news publicly on social media, and her son William confirmed her death with Ars Technica. Heineman’s GoFundMe page, which displayed a final message she had
posted
about entering palliative care, will now help her family with funeral costs.
Rebecca “Burger Becky” Heineman was born in October 1963 and grew up in Whittier, California. She first gained national recognition in 1980 when she
won
the national Atari 2600
Space Invaders
championship in New York at age 16, becoming the first formally recognized US video game champion. That victory launched a career
spanning
more than four decades and 67 credited games, according to MobyGames.
Among many achievements in her life, Heineman was perhaps best known for co-founding
Interplay Productions
with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell in 1983. The company created franchises like
Wasteland
,
Fallout
, and
Baldur’s Gate
. At Interplay, Heineman designed
The Bard’s Tale III: Thief of Fate
and
Dragon Wars
while also programming ports of classics like
Wolfenstein 3D
and
Battle Chess
.

After leaving Interplay in 1995, Heineman founded Logicware and later Contraband Entertainment in 1999.</div>

Samsung
just beat
Amazon
at its own game by smashing the previous best-ever price for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 – and it’ll give you double the storage for no extra cost. That means you can get a
512GB Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for $1,399.99 at Samsung.com
– down from $2,199.99.
The previous best price we’ve seen for the Z Fold 7 was at Amazon, where the 256GB model was $1,584.99 – the retail giant currently sells the foldable for $1,599.99. This Samsung deal utterly demolishes that previous best discount, and everything else out there, so this is one you don’t want to miss.
If you have an old phone to trade in, you could snag additional cost savings of up to $1,000 – though only expect the max amount if you have something like a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra going spare.
Just note that we&#x27;ve found the page can be a little buggy and not show the deal properly. Refresh a few times, and it should show up eventually.

Today&#x27;s best Galaxy Z Fold 7 Black Friday deal
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7:
was $2,119.99
now $1,399.99
at Samsung
This is the best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal I’ve ever seen, especially when you consider Samsung isn’t just giving you a massive discount, it’s also giving you extra storage. This means more local room for photos, videos, apps, and games. It’ll be tough to beat this deal this Black Friday, so it’s one you might want to grab sooner rather than later.

Black Friday
doesn’t officially take place until Friday, November 28th; however, if you want to shop ahead of time, we’ve rounded up the
best early Black Friday deals
you can already get.
Some people rarely lose things. Wallets are always exactly where they’re supposed to be, keys never go missing, and remotes never slip between the couch cushions. And then there’s the rest of us — the folks who can’t

MacBook Air deal: Get Apple&#x27;s M4-powered laptop for $750 for Black Friday
Pick it up while it&#x27;s 25 percent off.

The Apple MacBook Air M4 laptop has long hovered at $799 at Amazon — a full $200 below its Apple Store price. But it just
dropped down to $749
, which is the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen since this model was introduced in March. This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, across all four colorways, but the
512GB model is also down to $949
— another all-time low versus the Apple Store price of $1,199.
The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go.

Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks.

                <div class="summary">When Nigel Morris tells you he’s worried about the economy, you listen. As industry observers know, Morris co-founded Capital One and pioneered lending to subprime borrowers, building an empire on understanding exactly how much financial stress the average American can handle. Now, as an early investor in
Klarna
and other buy-now-pay-later companies like
Aplazo
in Mexico, he’s watching something that makes him deeply uncomfortable.
“To see that people are using [BNPL services] to buy something as basic and fundamental as groceries,” Morris told me on stage at
Web Summit
in Lisbon this week, “I think is a pretty clear indication that a lot of people are struggling.”
The statistics back up his unease. Buy-now-pay-later services have exploded to 91.5 million users in the United States, according to the financial services firm
Empower
, with 25% using the services to finance their groceries as of earlier this year, according to
survey data
released in late October by lending marketplace Lending Tree.
These aren’t the discretionary purchases —  the designer bags and latest Apple headphones that BNPL was marketed for originally. Borrowers aren’t paying it back, either. According to Lending Tree, default rates are accelerating: 42% of BNPL users made at least one late payment in 2025, up from 39% in 2024 and 34% in 2023.
Storm clouds on the horizon
This isn’t just a consumer finance story; it’s a canary in the coal mine for the entire venture-backed fintech ecosystem and beyond. It points to what could develop into a serious problem — one that echoes the warning signs that preceded the 2008 financial meltdown except for one thing: it’s largely invisible.
Most BNPL loans aren’t reported to credit bureaus, creating what regulators call “phantom debt.” That means other lenders can’t see when someone has taken out five different BNPL loans across multiple platforms. The credit system is flying blind.</div>

Human-centric IAM is failing: Agentic AI requires a new identity control plane
Michelle Buckner
November 16, 2025
The race to deploy
agentic AI is on
. Across the enterprise, systems that can plan, take actions and collaborate across business applications promise unprecedented efficiency. But in the rush to automate, a critical component is being overlooked: Scalable security. We are building a workforce of digital employees without giving them a secure way to log in, access data and do their jobs without creating catastrophic risk.
The fundamental problem is that traditional identity and access management (IAM) designed for humans breaks at agentic scale. Controls like static roles, long-lived passwords and one-time approvals are useless when non-human identities can outnumber human ones by 10 to one. To harness the power of agentic AI, identity must evolve from a simple login gatekeeper into the dynamic control plane for your entire AI operation.
“The fastest path to responsible AI is to avoid real data. Use synthetic data to prove value, then earn the right to touch the real thing.” —
Shawn Kanungo, keynote speaker and innovation strategist; bestselling author of The Bold Ones
Why your human-centric IAM is a sitting duck
Agentic AI
does not just use software; it behaves like a user. It authenticates to systems, assumes roles and calls APIs. If you treat these agents as mere features of an application, you invite invisible privilege creep and untraceable actions. A single over-permissioned agent can exfiltrate data or trigger erroneous business processes at machine speed, with no one the wiser until it is too late.
The static nature of legacy IAM is the core vulnerability. You cannot pre-define a fixed role for an agent whose tasks and required data access might change daily. The only way to keep access decisions accurate is to move policy enforcement from a one-time grant to a continuous, runtime evaluation.</div>

The evolution of rationality: How chimps process conflicting evidence
Chimps can take in new evidence, evaluate its strength, and change their minds.

When Aristotle claimed that humans differ from other animals because they have the ability to be rational, he understood rational to mean that we could form our views and beliefs based on evidence, and that we could reconsider that evidence. “You know—ask ourselves if we should really believe that based on the evidence we’ve got,” says Jan M. Engelmann, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley.
Engelmann says that from the beginning of the Western intellectual tradition, people thought that only humans are rational. So, he designed a study to see if rationality shows up in chimpanzees. It turned out that they’re almost as rational as we are.
Food puzzles
“There was quite a bit of research showing that chimpanzees can form their beliefs in response to evidence,” Engelmann says. The experiments usually involved chimpanzees deciding which of the two boxes contained a snack. When the researchers shook both boxes and there was a rattling sound coming from one of them, the chimps almost always chose the box where the rattling came from.
“But no one has ever looked into their ability to revise beliefs in rational ways,” Engelmann explains. He views revision of beliefs as the hallmark of rationality, a perspective that’s consistent with our best knowledge in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. “There are so many irrational ways of responding to counter evidence—you know, ‘I’m gonna keep believing what I believe, I’m not gonna switch my mind,’” Engelmann claims.</div>
