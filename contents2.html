                <div class="summary">Masayoshi Son isn’t known for half measures. The SoftBank founder’s career has been studded with eyebrow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last.
His latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake to go all-in on AI. And while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it’s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn’t push his chips to the center of the table.
Consider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son’s net worth soared to about $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally – which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history — as SoftBank’s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion.
Amid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth
$150 billion
by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry’s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.
That Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn’t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley.
After journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as “horrific and deeply regrettable” but insisted SoftBank couldn’t “turn our backs on the Saudi people,” maintaining the firm’s commitment to managing the kingdom’s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.
That didn’t turn out so well.</div>

Senior software developers are preparing for a major shift in how they work as artificial intelligence becomes central to their workflows, according to
BairesDev’s
latest
Dev Barometer
report publishing tomorrow. VentureBeat was given an exclusive early look and the findings below come directly from that report.
The quarterly global survey, which polled 501 developers and 19 project managers across 92 software initiatives, finds that nearly two-thirds (65%) of senior developers expect their roles to be redefined by AI in 2026.
The data highlights a transformation underway in software development: fewer routine coding tasks, more emphasis on design and strategy, and a rising need for AI fluency.
From Coders to Strategists
Among those anticipating change, 74% say they expect to shift from hands-on coding to designing solutions.
Another 61% plan to integrate AI-generated code into their workflows, and half foresee spending more time on system strategy and architecture.
“It’s not about lines of code anymore,” said Justice Erolin, Chief Technology Officer at BairesDev, in a recent interview with
VentureBeat
conducted over video call. “It’s about the quality and type of code, and the kind of work developers are doing.”
Erolin said the company is watching developers evolve from individual contributors into system thinkers.
“AI is great at code scaffolding and generating unit tests, saving developers around eight hours a week,” he explained. “That time can now be used for solution architecture and strategy work—areas where AI still falls short.”
The survey’s data reflects this shift. Developers are moving toward higher-value tasks while automation takes over much of the repetitive coding that once occupied junior engineers.</div>

A Reddit moderator known as “KlammereFyr” was recently
convicted
by a Danish court after clipping and posting hundreds of nude scenes that actresses filmed for movies and TV shows but apparently never expected to be shared out of context.
As TorrentFreak
reported
, dozens of actresses had complained about the mod’s sub-reddit, “SeDetForPlottet” (WatchItForthePlot), with some feeling “molested or abused.”
Demanding Danish police put an end to the forum, the Rights Alliance—representing the Danish Actors’ Association, two broadcasters, and other rightsholders—pushed for a criminal probe.
The groups argued that KlammereFyr removed the artistic context and immorally sexualized actors, sometimes by cropping scenes or “changing the lighting to accentuate certain features,” TorrentFreak reported.
To groups, it seemed clear that KlammereFyr was violating a rarely tested part of copyright law that protects artists’ “integrity” by shielding their “moral rights.”
In Denmark, the “right of integrity means that even in cases where you are allowed to make use of a work, you are not allowed to change it or use it in a way or in a context that infringes the author’s literary or artistic reputation or uniqueness,” a
resource
for Danish researchers noted.
Ultimately, a now 40-year-old man was charged after confessing to violating moral rights by sharing at least 347 clips featuring over 100 actresses that a Danish outlet reported were viewed 4.2 million times.</div>

Microsoft finds Whisper Leak shows privacy flaws inside encrypted AI systems
Encrypted AI chats may still leak clues about what users discuss
Attackers can track conversation topics using packet size and timing
Microsoft
has revealed a new type of cyberattack it has called &quot;Whisper Leak&quot;, which is able to expose the topics users discuss with AI chatbots, even when conversations are fully encrypted.
The company’s
research
suggests attackers can study the size and timing of encrypted packets exchanged between a user and a large language model to infer what is being discussed.
&quot;If a government agency or internet service provider were monitoring traffic to a popular AI
chatbot
, they could reliably identify users asking questions about specific sensitive topics,&quot; Microsoft said.

Whisper Leak attacks
This means &quot;encrypted&quot; doesn’t necessarily mean invisible - with the vulnerability lies in how
LLMs
send responses.
These models do not wait for a complete reply, but transmit data incrementally, creating small patterns that attackers can analyze.
Over time, as they collect more samples, these patterns become clearer, allowing more accurate guesses about the nature of conversations.
This technique doesn’t decrypt messages directly but exposes enough metadata to make educated inferences, which is arguably just as concerning.</div>

Disney’s spat with Google’s YouTube TV over a new content distribution contract is costing the entertainment giant $4.3 million a day in lost revenue, Morgan Stanley estimates.
That’s $30 million a week as the blackout of channels including
ABC
and
ESPN
stretches into its 12th day,
Variety
reports
, though the analysts expect Disney and Google to reach a resolution by the end of the week. The dispute is also costing Google —

reports that
a Drive Research survey
of 1,100 US consumers found 24 percent canceled or planned to cancel their subscriptions.
More than 20 Disney-owned channels
went dark on YouTube TV
after their contract expired at 11:59 PM ET on October 30th.</div>

Nintendo and Lego tease a Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time set
And yes, we do realize who we&#x27;re dealing with.

Nintendo/Lego
Lego has a long history of geek and gaming crossovers. We&#x27;ve seen recent sets for
Star Wars
and
Star Trek
, while past collaborations include everything from
Super Mario Bros.
to
Minecraft
. The latest blocky tie-in is a classic:
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
, as teased on social network X by Nintendo of America with the caption “Do you realize who you’re dealing with?”
The short video clip recreates a scene from the game, with a minifig of Link armed with his Hylian shield and Master Sword beside a tiny floating Navi fairy. (Presumably Lego Navi will not interrupt you with &quot;Hey! Listen!&quot; every five minutes, but maybe the company is striving for total accuracy.) A blurry Zelda minifig stands behind them, and the heroes stare upward at the looming shadow of what must be a Ganon character. Whether the villain is a minifig of his own or a larger-than-life constructed model remains to be seen. The set won&#x27;t be released until 2026, but most likely either Lego or Nintendo will reveal more details ahead of the launch date.
This isn&#x27;t the first time Hyrule is getting the Lego treatment. The brands&#x27; debut
Legend of Zelda
collab was a set of the
Great Deku Tree
that came out last year, and it could be built as either the wise arboreal being from
Ocarina of Time
or from
Breath of the Wild
.

announced
on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more.
For example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations.
Or, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”
Google says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.
For example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says.
To access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button.
Google says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older.

Meta returns to open source AI with Omnilingual ASR models that can transcribe 1,600+ languages natively

Meta has just released a new
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) system
supporting 1,600+ languages — dwarfing OpenAI’s open source Whisper model, which supports just 99.
Is architecture also allows developers to extend that support to thousands more. Through a feature called zero-shot in-context learning, users can provide a few paired examples of audio and text in a new language at inference time, enabling the model to transcribe additional utterances in that language without any retraining.
In practice, this expands potential coverage to more than 5,400 languages — roughly every spoken language with a known script.
It’s a shift from static model capabilities to a flexible framework that communities can adapt themselves. So while the 1,600 languages reflect official training coverage, the broader figure represents Omnilingual ASR’s capacity to generalize on demand, making it the most extensible speech recognition system released to date.
Best of all: it&#x27;s been open sourced under
a plain Apache 2.0 license
— not a restrictive, quasi open-source Llama license like the company&#x27;s prior releases, which limited use by larger enterprises unless they paid licensing fees — meaning researchers and developers are free to take and implement it right away, for free, without restrictions, even in commercial and enterprise-grade projects!
Released on November 10 on
Meta&#x27;s website
,
Github
, along with a
demo space on Hugging Face
and
technical paper
, Meta’s Omnilingual ASR suite includes a family of speech recognition models, a 7-billion parameter multilingual audio representation model, and a massive speech corpus spanning over 350 previously underserved languages.</div>

The heads of
Apple TV
have “no plans” to bring ads to the streaming service, balking, at least for now, at a strategy that has driven success for Apple’s streaming rivals.
In its November 2025 issue, British movie magazine
Screen International
asked Eddy Cue, SVP of Apple Services, if there are plans to launch an ad-based subscription tier for Apple TV. Cue responded:
Nothing at this time. … I don’t want to say no forever, but there are no plans. If we can stay aggressive with our pricing, it’s better for consumers not to get interrupted with ads.
The comments follow reports over the years suggesting that Apple has been seeking knowledge on how to build a streaming ads business. Most recently,
The Telegraph
reported that Apple TV executives met with the United Kingdom’s ratings body, Barb, to discuss what tracking ads on Apple TV would look like. In 2023, Apple
hired
advertising exec Lauren Fry as head of video and Apple News ad sales.
For Apple, “aggressive” pricing has meant three
price hikes
since Apple TV’s 2019 launch and a current monthly subscription fee of $13. For comparison, Netflix starts at $18 per month without ads, and Disney+ is $19/month without ads.
Introducing ads seems like a natural progression for Apple TV, not only because that’s what the competition is doing, but also because Apple TV reportedly doesn’t make money.</div>
