                <div class="summary">Google
announced
on Monday that it’s starting to roll out Gemini to the Google TV Streamer, replacing Google Assistant. The tech giant says the change will enable users to use their voice more naturally to access content and more.
For example, users can now ask something like, “I like dramas but my wife likes comedies. What’s a movie we can watch together?” when looking for movie recommendations.
Or, users could quickly catch up on a show they’re returning to by asking something like, “What happened at the end of Outlander last season?” In another example, Google says users can even ask something like “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”
Google says Gemini for TV goes beyond entertainment, as users can ask the AI assistant any other type of question as well, just like they can with Gemini on their phone.
For example, users could bring learning to their TV by asking Gemini to “Explain why volcanoes erupt to my third grader.” Gemini can also guide users through DIY projects or recipes with YouTube videos, Google says.
To access Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, you need to press your remote’s microphone button.
Google says the update is rolling out “over the next few weeks” to users aged 18 and older.

Meta returns to open source AI with Omnilingual ASR models that can transcribe 1,600+ languages natively

Meta has just released a new
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) system
supporting 1,600+ languages — dwarfing OpenAI’s open source Whisper model, which supports just 99.
Is architecture also allows developers to extend that support to thousands more. Through a feature called zero-shot in-context learning, users can provide a few paired examples of audio and text in a new language at inference time, enabling the model to transcribe additional utterances in that language without any retraining.
In practice, this expands potential coverage to more than 5,400 languages — roughly every spoken language with a known script.
It’s a shift from static model capabilities to a flexible framework that communities can adapt themselves. So while the 1,600 languages reflect official training coverage, the broader figure represents Omnilingual ASR’s capacity to generalize on demand, making it the most extensible speech recognition system released to date.
Best of all: it&#x27;s been open sourced under
a plain Apache 2.0 license
— not a restrictive, quasi open-source Llama license like the company&#x27;s prior releases, which limited use by larger enterprises unless they paid licensing fees — meaning researchers and developers are free to take and implement it right away, for free, without restrictions, even in commercial and enterprise-grade projects!
Released on November 10 on
Meta&#x27;s website
,
Github
, along with a
demo space on Hugging Face
and
technical paper
, Meta’s Omnilingual ASR suite includes a family of speech recognition models, a 7-billion parameter multilingual audio representation model, and a massive speech corpus spanning over 350 previously underserved languages.</div>

The heads of
Apple TV
have “no plans” to bring ads to the streaming service, balking, at least for now, at a strategy that has driven success for Apple’s streaming rivals.
In its November 2025 issue, British movie magazine
Screen International
asked Eddy Cue, SVP of Apple Services, if there are plans to launch an ad-based subscription tier for Apple TV. Cue responded:
Nothing at this time. … I don’t want to say no forever, but there are no plans. If we can stay aggressive with our pricing, it’s better for consumers not to get interrupted with ads.
The comments follow reports over the years suggesting that Apple has been seeking knowledge on how to build a streaming ads business. Most recently,
The Telegraph
reported that Apple TV executives met with the United Kingdom’s ratings body, Barb, to discuss what tracking ads on Apple TV would look like. In 2023, Apple
hired
advertising exec Lauren Fry as head of video and Apple News ad sales.
For Apple, “aggressive” pricing has meant three
price hikes
since Apple TV’s 2019 launch and a current monthly subscription fee of $13. For comparison, Netflix starts at $18 per month without ads, and Disney+ is $19/month without ads.
Introducing ads seems like a natural progression for Apple TV, not only because that’s what the competition is doing, but also because Apple TV reportedly doesn’t make money.</div>

IMSCAD offers direct access to powerful Lenovo workstations for demanding design tasks
Workstations are hosted in Equinix Data Centres with 1:1 user connections
Monthly contracts range from one month to 36 months for flexible usage
IMSCAD and
Lenovo
workstations now offer a remote setup for users who need to run heavy design and 3D software without paying the high prices of public cloud services.
The service gives each user a 1:1 link to a
workstation
such as the ThinkStation P3 Ultra with a Gen 9
Intel
CPU that reaches 6.0 GHz and an
Nvidia
chip with up to 24GB of VRAM.
The provider delivers this hardware through
cloud hosting
, promising lower costs while maintaining consistent performance.

Google started rolling out its new
Gemini voice assistant
for its smart speakers two weeks ago and, in a
blog post
marking the anniversary, the company seems to think everything is going great. It’s even quoting a user who said, “My Google Home just got upgraded with Gemini. It’s actually useful now beyond asking for today’s weather.” That’s some not-so-subtle shade right there.
But dig
into the post’s FAQ
, and things don’t look so rosy.</div>

Snap is bringing back 2D Bitmoji for Snapchat+ subscribers
Nearly 100,000 people signed a petition demanding the return of flatter avatars.

Snap is offering
Snapchat+ subscribers
the chance to have 2D Bitmoji avatars once again. In the coming days, they’ll be able to activate a setting called Comic Bitmoji.
Snap said
this will revive “the charm of classic avatars, while keeping all the benefits of today’s 3D infrastructure.” If you turn on Comic Bitmoji, all Bitmoji avatars that you see in Snapchat will be rendered in 2D. You’ll also be able to send stickers to your friends in that style.
Snap switched from 2D to 3D avatars back in 2023. The company said the move allowed it to offer a larger array of customizations, including more body types, hairstyles and makeup looks.
However, many users yearned for a return to a 2D look. Nearly 100,000 of them signed a
Change.org petition
demanding the return of 2D Bitmoji, and Snap said it listened. CEO Evan Spiegel signed the petition too.

Snap says Comic Bitmoji effectively applies a filter to the 3D avatars. To make the animations and expressions work properly in the 2D format, the team had to make adjustments to proportions, shading and outlines, according to
Fast Company
. Snap said that more than 320 million people use Bitmoji every day, so getting the 2D renders right was important.
It’s a little disappointing that Snap is locking the the Comic Bitmoji setting behind a paywall. However, it seems like just the kind of feature that might prompt more users to sign up for a Snapchat+ subscription.

This allows the spacecraft to wait until Earth and Mars are correctly aligned in November of next year, departing from Earth when Mars is over 220 million miles away.

                <div class="summary">The cost of cooling Nvidia&#x27;s high-end rack systems, such as the Blackwell Ultra NVL72, is rapidly increasing due to the escalating power demands of AI workloads. A Morgan Stanley report indicates that the liquid cooling hardware for a GB300 NVL72 rack costs nearly $50,000, comparable to a Tesla Model Y. Projections suggest that the cooling system for the newer Vera Rubin NVL144 configuration will be even more expensive, reaching approximately $55,710. This surge in cooling expenses is driven by the need for higher-capacity cold plates for individual compute trays, as Nvidia pushes deeper into extreme power levels with each successive generation of GPUs.</div>
