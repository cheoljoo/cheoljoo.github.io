YC startups can now receive investment in stablecoin
All startups accepted into YC will soon have the option to receive their seed checks via stablecoins, crypto YC partner Nemil Dalal
told The Block. YC’s famous
“standard deal”
is that it invests $500,000 into startups accepted into its program in exchange for 7% of their companies. Now that deal is hitting the blockchain (Base, Solana, and Ethereum, to be exact), starting with the upcoming spring batch. Dalal said that stablecoin transfers are often more effective, specifically for founders working in emerging markets. But also, YC is putting its money where its mouth is, so to speak. Last fall, YC
partnered with
Base and Coinbase Ventures to encourage founders to build more blockchain
-related companies. Interest in blockchain tech is on the rise again in Silicon Valley as the U.S. has taken steps toward
more formal, crypto-friendly regulation of the industry. Topics

                <div class="summary">SOC teams are automating triage — but 40% will fail without governance boundaries
Louis Columbus
January 27, 2026
The average enterprise SOC receives 10,000 alerts per day. Each requires
20 to 40 minutes
to investigate properly, but even fully staffed teams can only handle 22% of them. More than
60% of security teams have admitted to ignoring alerts
that later proved critical. Running an efficient SOC has never been harder, and now the work itself is changing. Tier-1 analyst tasks — like triage, enrichment, and escalation — are becoming software functions, and more SOC teams are turning to supervised AI agents to handle the volume. Human analysts are shifting their priorities to investigate, review, and make edge-case decisions. Response times are being reduced. Not integrating human insight and intuition comes with a high cost, however. Gartner predicts
over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled
by the end of 2027, with the main drivers being unclear business value and inadequate governance. Getting change management right and making sure generative AI doesn’t become a
chaos agent
in the SOC are even more important. Why the legacy SOC model needs to change
Burnout is so severe in many SOCs today that
senior analysts are considering career changes
. Legacy SOCs that have multiple systems that deliver conflicting alerts, and the many systems that can’t talk to each other at all, are making the job a recipe for burnout, and the talent pipeline cannot refill faster than burnout empties it. CrowdStrike&#x27;s 2025 Global Threat Report documents
breakout times as fast as 51 seconds
and found 79% of intrusions are now malware-free. Attackers rely on identity abuse, credential theft, and living-off-the-land techniques instead. Manual triage built for hourly response cycles cannot compete. As Matthew Sharp, CISO at Xactly,
told CSO Online

Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for
Animal Crossing
) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2. The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (
PDF
). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo
introduced in August of 2025
, citing “market conditions.”
That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became
the third-bestselling game console of all time
. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life.</div>

If you&#x27;re looking for a portable second screen that does justice to your laptop or monitor, then you&#x27;ll definitely want to check out
Arzopa&#x27;s 16.1-inch portable monitor, now $140 (was $200) at Amazon
. Beyond the boosted screen space, specs are great here, with a 2.5K resolution for extra detail you don&#x27;t always get on similarly sized portable displays. And when it comes to balancing price and performance, Arzopa makes some of the
best portable monitors
we&#x27;ve tested for both work and play. I can&#x27;t recommend getting a second screen enough. A portable monitor can be a seriously useful, low-cost upgrade if you work on a laptop, travel frequently, or just want more screen space without committing to a full desk setup. Adding a second display makes it easier to keep reference material open, manage e...</div>

Microsoft says it is working on the Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), an AI licensing hub that shows usage terms set by publishers. That way, AI companies can easily shop the terms and set up deals to use online content for “grounding” their AI models, while the content owners get usage-based reporting to help set prices. Microsoft says it’s been codesigning PCM with companies including

parent Vox Media, The Associated Press, Condé Nast, People, and others. The AI boom has been largely fueled by content ingested without payment, and many of the previously mentioned publishers have filed lawsuits and/or arranged content licensing deals as traffic from traditional sources drops.

Apple just made Xcode better for vibe coding
Xcode 26.3 brings more robust support for programming agents like Claude. Igor Bonifacic

Apple has just
released Xcode 26.3
, and it&#x27;s a big step forward in terms of the company&#x27;s support of coding agents. The new release expands on the AI features the company introduced with Xcode 26 at WWDC 2025 to give systems like Claude and ChatGPT more robust access to its in-house IDE. With the update, Apple says Claude and OpenAI&#x27;s Codex &quot;can search documentation, explore file structures, update project settings, and verify their work visually by capturing Xcode Previews and iterating through builds and fixes.&quot; This is in contrast to earlier releases of Xcode 26 where those same agents were limited in what they could see of a developer&#x27;s Xcode environment, restricting their utility. According to Apple, the change will give users tools they can use to streamline their processes and work more efficiently than before. Developers can add Claude and Codex to their Xcode terminal from the Intelligence section of the app&#x27;s setting menu. Once a provider is selected, the interface allows users to also pick their preferred model. So if you like the outputs of say GPT 5.1 over GPT 5.2, you can use the older system. Advertisement

The tighter integration with Claude and Codex was made possible by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers Apple has deployed. MCP is a technology Anthropic debuted in
fall 2024
to make it easier for large language models like Claude to share data with third-party tools and systems. Since its introduction, MCP has become an industry standard — with OpenAI, for instance,

                <div class="summary">Cloud data company Snowflake entered into a
$200 million multi-year AI deal
with OpenAI on Monday, the latest signal that enterprise AI competition continues to heat up.
Under the deal, Snowflake’s 12,600 customers will have access to OpenAI models across all three major cloud providers. Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products.
“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”
OpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release.
If this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a
$200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic
at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.
“Our partnership with OpenAI is a multi-year commercial commitment focused on reliability, performance, and real customer usage. At the same time, we remain intentionally model-agnostic. Enterprises need choice, and we do not believe in locking customers into a single provider,” Baris Gultekin, vice president of AI at Snowflake, told TechCrunch over email. “OpenAI is an important partner, and it is one of...</div>

The key to successful AI agents within an enterprise? Shared memory and context.
This, according to
Asana
CPO Arnab Bose, provides detailed history and direct access from the get-go — with guardrail checkpoints and human oversight, of course.
This way, “when you assign a task, you&#x27;re not having to go ahead and re-provide all of the context about how your business works,” Bose said at a recent VB event in San Francisco.
AI as an active teammate, rather than a passive add-on
Asana launched Asana AI Teammates last year with the philosophy that, just like humans, AI agents should be plugged directly into a team or project to create a collaborative system. To further this mission, the project management company has
fully integrated with Anthropic’s Claude
.
Users can choose from 12 pre-built agents — for common use cases like IT ticket deflection — or build their own, then assign them to project teams and immediately provide a historical record of what tasks have already been completed and what is still yet to be resolved. Agents also have access to third-party resources like Microsoft 365 or Google Drive.
“When that agent gets created, it&#x27;s not acting on behalf of someone, it manifests itself as a teammate and it gets all of the same sharing permissions, it inherits that,” Bose explained. Everything anyone does — humans and AI included — is documented to allow for “ease of explainability” and a “very transparent and trustworthy system.”
But just like human workers, AI agents are kept in check: Critically, workflows incorporate checkpoints, where humans can give feedback and ask the agent to tweak certain elements of a project or adjust research plans. This is documented in what Bose called a “very human-readable way.”
Also importantly, the UI provides instruction...</div>

The Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on Friday included at least a few dozen unredacted nude photos and names of at least 43 victims, according to news reports.
The DOJ missed a December 19 deadline set by the
Epstein Files Transparency Act
by more than a month, but still released the files without fully redacting nude photos and names of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. The New York Times
reported
yesterday that it found “nearly 40 unredacted images that appeared to be part of a personal photo collection, showing both nude bodies and the faces of the people portrayed.”
While the people in the photos were young, “it was unclear whether they were minors,” the article said. “Some of the images seemed to show Mr. Epstein’s private island, including a beach. Others were taken in bedrooms and other private spaces.” The photos “appeared to show at least seven different people,” the article said.
The Times said it notified government officials of the nude images and that the pictures have since been “largely removed o...</div>

Make no mistake – I&#x27;m a big Lego fan and build sets across all kinds of themes. But in the past few years, beyond Technic,
Star Wars
, and Disney, the Botanicals line has become something of a phenomenon. Whether it&#x27;s a miniature bonsai tree, an elegant orchid, or a vibrant bouquet, these are some of Lego&#x27;s most creative and best-designed sets.
And with
Valentine&#x27;s Day just 12 days away,
Lego flowers make an almost perfect gift. They can be a collaborative activity if you want; they never need watering, and they last forever. The
Bouquet of Roses
won&#x27;twon&#x27;t won&#x27;t lose its punchy red color and offers a fun, brick-built twist on the classic dozen. I&#x27;m also especially fond of the
Botanicals Mini Orchid
– currently down to just $23.95 on
Amazon
– which is a relaxing, enjoyable build with great color and a finished look that genuinely resembles the real thing.
The
Flowering Cactus
is another standout, featuring a lovely blue pot you&#x27;ll assemble alongside an iconic green cactus topped with a vibrant pink bloom. If you&#x27;re after something a little more classic, the equally charming
Succulents
set is well worth a look. I&#x27;ve also included a forthcoming Botanicals release that&#x27;s already sitting in my cart – Lego is finally tackling sunflowers in the form of a five-piece bouquet.
