                <div class="summary">AI startup ElevenLabs has launched Eleven Music, a new prompt-based AI music generation service that creates royalty-free music for commercial use. The service can generate songs with vocals and lyrics in just a few minutes based on natural language prompts. ElevenLabs has been quietly testing the platform with 20 customers who have used it for films, TV shows, video games, and apps. The company has secured deals with digital rights agencies Merlin Network and Kobalt Music Group for training data, with CEO Mati Staniszewski aiming to bring major labels on board. ElevenLabs emphasizes that &#x27;the model is strictly created on data that we have access to,&#x27; positioning itself advantageously compared to competitors like Suno and Udio, which face lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement. The company is primarily known for voice-generation technology and has created tools used for celebrity deepfakes and AI news reading services.</div>

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, went further,<br>predicting<br>that AI could be &quot;10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.&quot;<br>Intelligence, or at least thinking, is increasingly shared between people and machines. Some people have begun to regularly use AI in their workflows. Others have gone further, integrating it into their cognitive routines and creative identities. These are the &quot;<br>willing<br>,&quot; including the consultants fluent in prompt design, the product managers retooling systems and those building their own businesses that do everything from coding to product design to marketing.<br>For them, the terrain feels new but navigable. Exciting, even. But for many others, this moment feels strange, and more than a little unsettling. The risk they face is not just being left behind. It is not knowing how, when and whether to invest in AI, a future that seems highly uncertain, and one that is difficult to imagine their place in. That is the double risk of<br>AI readiness<br>, and it is reshaping how people interpret the pace, promises and pressure of this transition.</div>

As first spotted by<br>PC Gamer<br>, AOL made the surprising announcement in a post buried in its AOL Help pages. Along with the dial-up service, AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser will also be discontinued by the end of September.<br>It may come as a shock to most that AOL still runs its dial-up Internet service, but some<br>thousands of users<br>still rely on this outdated method as an affordable way to access the Internet in more rural areas. However, these user numbers in the &quot;low thousands&quot; are a far cry from AOL&#x27;s heyday, which reportedly saw tens of millions of<br>subscribers<br>, most likely thanks to the stacks of free trial CDs people would find in their mailboxes. Nowadays, dial-up Internet fails to compete against the likes of much faster broadband options, which include cable, fiber and satellite alternatives.<br>Even though AOL&#x27;s dial-up service eventually lost relevancy, it stuck around for 34 years before meeting the same fate as other &#x27;90s tech icons like Blockbuster, Discmans and<br>AOL Instant Messenger<br>.

                <div class="source-content">Chowdeck<br>, a Lagos-based food delivery startup that has stayed profitable in a<br>notoriously tough and low-margin market<br>, has raised $9 million in Series A funding to launch a quick commerce strategy and expand into more cities in Nigeria and Ghana.<br>The equity round was led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others. The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.<br>“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder<br>Femi Aluko<br>said. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”<br>Founded in October 2021 by Aluko,<br>Olumide Ojo<br>, and<br>Lanre Yusuf<br>, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.<br>While prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets—delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge—to build trust with customers.<br>In 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.<br>The new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week.

In Europe,<br>Gorillas and Getir<br>burned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like<br>Blinkit<br>,<br>Zepto<br>and<br>Swiggy<br>have had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.<br>Chowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks.<br>For instance, the food delivery platform<br>entered neighbouring Ghana this May<br>. Within three months,<br>it was handling 1,000 daily orders<br>without paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisines. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.<br>Aluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.<br>Another vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June,<br>the YC-backed startup acquired Mira<br>, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.<br>Chowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector,<br>after Jumia’s exit<br>left market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet,<br>some of these companies<br>have also withdrawn<br>from certain markets<br>, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively.<br>Super apps such as Gozem, YC-backed<br>Yassir<br>, and<br>MNT-Halan<br>are other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.<br>“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”<br>For lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”<br>Nigeria’s YC-backed Chowdeck hopes to scale food delivery, a notoriously tough market, with $2.5M funding<br>Topics<br>Africa<br>,<br>Chowdeck<br>,<br>food apps<br>,<br>food delivery<br>,<br>nigeria food delivery<br>,<br>Startups<br>Tage Kene-Okafor<br>Reporter, Africa<br>Tage Kene-Okafor is a reporter at TechCrunch based in Lagos, Nigeria, covering the intersection of startups and venture capital in Africa.

According to the latest insights, the approximate amount of ransoms paid globally in 2024 reached $813.55 million.<br>When requested to pay a ransom, companies know that refusing to do so runs the risk of their customers’ personal information being leaked publicly, which would additionally require them to pay the associated financial penalties and legal payouts, not to mention reputational damage.<br>Addressing the threat of cyber-attacks must be embedded in a company’s culture, given the fact that if threat actors are successful, the impact of their actions would be felt not only company-wide but also by the ecosystem within which the organization operates.<br>Leadership and security<br>Organizations can bolster their security by cultivating strong leadership, providing tailored training, and building a proactive security culture to create a ‘human firewall’ of colleagues armed with know-how.<br>Employees<br>of all skillsets and seniorities should undergo comprehensive and ongoing cyber awareness training, whatever their role and seniority, to drive the defenses forward and cultivate a mindful culture.<br>When employees are provided with the knowledge and tools to maintain awareness of the dangers their company is facing, they can be the most effective method to keep the business secure.<br>Building a mindful culture<br>Building a mindful culture can be complemented by a Zero Trust approach, which creates a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. This strategic approach mandates rigorous verification for all access requests, irrespective of their origin or the user&#x27;s location within the network, thereby yielding exceptionally strong results that effectively eliminate a significant portion of potential threats.<br>For example, when an employee receives an email requesting sensitive information or a link to a suspicious<br>website<br>, they should be trained to recognize it as a potential phishing attempt right away, verify the sender&#x27;s identity, and report the email to the IT department for further investigation.<br>This proactive stance, ingrained through a Zero Trust philosophy and continuous education, significantly reduces the likelihood of successful breaches. It’s better safe than sorry, and in the realm of cybersecurity, this means being diligent about taking the extra steps to fortify an organization&#x27;s digital defenses.<br>Don&#x27;t stop at basic protections<br>Don&#x27;t stop at basic protections, make ongoing training a priority. Defenses can’t stop at antivirus technology and<br>endpoint protection<br>, and training isn’t a one-time solution. While these are the necessities, they are simply not enough for the twenty-first century heist as businesses continue to battle millions of cyber-attacks each month.<br>As threats advance or teams become complacent, ongoing phishing simulations, tests and education are key in maintaining a robust human firewall. Companies must invest in technology and ongoing training to equip employees across all roles and levels with the skills and awareness to stay alert. A company’s greatest weapon can be its workforce, if leveraged.<br>Cybersecurity needs tech, but it&#x27;s nothing without people who are well trained to understand the latest attack methods and protect against the digital transition&#x27;s inherent risks.<br>We list the best ransomware protection<br>.<br>This article was produced as part of TechRadarPro&#x27;s Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

But we’re a few months into the console’s lifecycle now and there are a variety of Switch 2-only games that are worth your cash, as well as a bunch of original Switch games that have received improvements for the new console And there’s also a robust selection of third-party games that have been on other consoles for a while, but not available on the Switch.<br>Between all those, there are plenty of good games for the Switch 2 — and if you don’t have an original Switch, there’s even more out there. You can see<br>our list of our favorite Switch games here<br>, but this list will focus on Switch 2 exclusives, original Switch games that have been improved for the new hardware and the best-performing, third-party titles worth your time. And keep an eye on this list, as there should be a lot more Switch 2 exclusives coming this fall that we&#x27;re excited to try, including eagerly-awaited titles like<br>Metroid Prime 4<br>.<br>Quick Overview<br>Switch 2 exclusive<br>Mario Kart World<br>More options<br>$79 at Amazon<br>Switch 2 exclusive<br>Donkey Kong Bananza<br>More options<br>$67 at Amazon<br>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition<br>More options<br>$69 at Amazon<br>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition<br>More options<br>$79 at Amazon<br>Fast Fusion<br>$15 at GameStop<br>See 4 more<br>Best Nintendo Switch 2 games for 2025<br>Nintendo<br>Switch 2 exclusive<br>Mario Kart World<br>Mario Kart World<br>isn’t quite the<br>reinvention<br>of the massively popular franchise that I thought it might be based on Nintendo’s extensive preview of the game. No matter. Mario Kart is a proven formula, and Nintendo has done more than enough to make<br>MKW<br>the kind of game that millions of people will play over the next decade or so. There are a ton of cleverly-designed new tracks that you can pick up and play immediately — but the more time you put into them, the more shortcuts and secrets you’ll find to help master them. There’s a truckload of Nintendo characters to pilot your kart or bike, from the heavy hitters to bizarre but amusing choices like a Piranha plant. And there are beefed-up multiplayer and sharing features powered by GameChat on the Switch 2.<br>But while<br>Mario Kart World<br>will feel familiar to the millions who played<br>Mario Kart 8<br>, it also introduces a few noteworthy new features. One is that the majority of courses don’t have you doing three laps around a track — instead, you’re driving from point A to point B, with every track being set in a part of a larger world (hence the name). And there’s an open-world mode where you’re not in a race. You can cruise from one side of the map to the other, looking for little bonus challenges, unlocking more outfits for your characters and finding other collectibles. There are hundreds of P-Switch challenges and dozens of Peach medallions and question mark boxes you can track down. The fact that you can’t cruise around free roam in multiplayer mode is a major bummer, and the world itself feels somewhat deserted as a result, but there’s still a ton to do here.<br>The open-world nature of the game also enables a new race type: Knockout mode. This is probably my favorite part — it’s an ongoing race across six courses with five checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, you have to be higher than a certain ranking or you’ll be eliminated. Being in the top 20 out of 24 total racers at the first checkpoint isn’t so tough, but obviously the challenge grows as the field is trimmed. Knockout mode is a great combo of a more traditional Grand Prix style race with a longer, world-crossing sprint to the finish. While I wish Nintendo took just a few more risks with<br>Mario Kart World,<br>it’s the kind of game anyone can pick up and have a blast with.<br>— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor<br>$79 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$80 at Macy&#x27;s<br>$80 at Target<br>Nintendo<br>Switch 2 exclusive<br>Donkey Kong Bananza<br>Nintendo hasn’t made a 3D Donkey Kong platformer since 1999, but<br>Donkey Kong Bananza<br>is<br>more than worth the wait<br>. I’d argue that it’s the first must-buy title for the Switch 2 and the most compelling reason to buy Nintendo’s latest console as soon as you can. It takes a delightful gaming mechanic (smashing nearly everything you can get your fists on) and builds a huge variety of engaging experiences around it. At first, I was worried I’d get tired of all the smashing, but the wide variety of different worlds and challenges keep things continuously fresh. The Bananza powers you pick up throughout the game definitely help with that, too — you can power up DK so his smashes are more potent, or transform into a speedy zebra to dash through obstacles or an ostrich that can float above them.<br>There’s also more story to the game than I expected, centering on DK and the 13-year-old girl Pauline who accompanies him through most of his adventures. She’s a charming sidekick and her love of singing is what helps DK unlock the aforementioned Bananza powers. The game is also absolutely gorgeous and visually stunning, with each world having a completely different vibe from the one that came before it — but they’re all wonderfully rendered. The music rules, too. Pauline’s songs are catchier than they have any right to be, and I had them stuck in my head long after I put the game down.<br>Donkey Kong Bananaza<br>is, quite simply, Nintendo at its best.<br>— N.I.<br>$67 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$70 at Macy&#x27;s<br>$70 at Target<br>Nintendo<br>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild — Switch 2 edition<br>As a launch title for the original Switch,<br>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild<br>was a massive critical and commercial success for Nintendo. It shook up the formula the series had largely stuck to for decades, gave players a massive version of Hyrule to explore and an endless variety of ways to tackle the game’s challenges. But even when it came out in 2017, it was clear that<br>Breath of the Wild<br>was pushing the Switch’s modest hardware to the limit. Framerates could often drop below 30, the game maxed out at 1080p resolution and load times were rather long.<br>For<br>Breath of the Wild<br>aficionados and new players alike, the Switch 2 edition of this classic is definitely worth your time. The framerate is essentially locked at 60fps and that makes a massive difference in how fluid the game feels. It can also run in up to 4K resolution when the Switch 2 is docked. And while the game’s art style is such that extreme fidelity isn’t always obvious, there’s no doubt it looks better overall. Faster load times when jumping in and out of shrines is also a major quality of life upgrade.<br>One of the coolest things about<br>Breath of the Wild<br>for the Switch 2 is the companion Zelda Notes tool. It’s part of the Switch smartphone app and lets you do things like turn on navigation to find shrines and other landmarks around Hyrule, as well as fun tidbits like voice memories for various locations and daily bonuses like free meals or weapon durability restores. The Switch 2 edition of<br>Breath of the Wild<br>is a $10 upgrade if you own the base game, but it’s free for anyone who subscribes to the $50 / year Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Park service.<br>— N.I.<br>$69 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$70 at Target<br>$90 at Macy&#x27;s<br>Nintendo<br>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — Switch 2 edition<br>With<br>Tears of the Kingdom<br>, Nintendo managed to follow up the reinvention of the Zelda series with a game that added more to discover and more to play with, and it even throws in a mystical LEGO kit. Link soon discovers Ultrahand, which lets you grab and stick objects, batteries, engines, weapons, food (and more) to other objects. It’s the standout addition compared to its predecessor; a creative toolbox of solutions (or foolish endeavors) to solve every puzzle, fight every beast and explore every part of<br>Tears of the Kingdom.<br>The Switch 2 edition adds the sort of improvements and upgrades that, arguably, warrant paying to upgrade your Switch edition. To start with, I struggled to make the frame rates choke in my current playthrough. On the original Switch, the gorgeous world of Hyrule would often stutter and slow as you transitioned between sky, surface and underground. The game’s framerates would peak at 30fps, while busy moments (or lots of custom building) could knock those rates severely.<br>On the Switch 2,<br>ToTK<br>runs at 60fps, locked. It plays smoothly, pretty much all the time, and it’s a big improvement to what is still a beautiful adventure. The new hardware adds HDR to the graphics. This expanded dynamic range comes into its own in the underground depths sections, the low-light areas a little clearer and easier to navigate. No surprise: loading times are also quicker when fast travelling and loading the game initially.<br>There are also gameplay quality-of-life upgrades, including audio logs you can discover and listen to on the companion smartphone app and the ability to both store and share your items, weapons and ingredients. If your favorite part was crafting spinning laser death machines, et al, with your Ultrahand, the ability to save builds as QR codes and share with friends is a fun addition, if a little limited in utility at the start. You will have to manually scour the internet for creations from people who aren’t on your friends list.<br>That limitation aside, the Switch 2 edition delivers plenty for that $10 upgrade charge – and Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass subscribers get both<br>ToTK<br>and<br>BoTW<br>upgrades for free.<br>— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief<br>$79 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$80 at Target<br>$80 at Best Buy<br>Shin&#x27;en Multimedia<br>Fast Fusion<br>Fast Fusion<br>is a sci-fi arcade racer that wears its influences proudly. It loves<br>Wipeout<br>and the 3D<br>F-Zero<br>games, and it wants little more than to bring their ideas into modern times. Fortunately, those games ruled, so there are much worse inspirations to rip from.<br>The key to<br>Fast Fusion<br>is right in the title: It is seriously fast, and it commits to that feeling of speed with every choice it makes. Whooshing lines drag from the back of your hard-angled ship, its engine wheezing, the background perpetually blurred. You and your opponents cut through the air like hands out the window of a speeding car. Gloriously, you can jump, sometimes skipping turns entirely, other times launching yourself into a fiery wreck. An<br>Ikaruga<br>-esque mechanic has you quickly match the color of your craft to the many boost pads littered around each course, and there’s a boost meter you can keep topped up by taking the right line through a given section. Do it all right, and you can complete whole races without ever slowing down. Miss a few, and you’re playing a game of resource management at 500 miles per hour.<br>There’s pretty much no continuity between each track: One race you’re dashing through a forest like it’s<br>Return of the Jedi<br>; the next you’re dodging tornadoes on a stormy highway. But they are spectacles, and crucially, they give you the space to maintain your speed, with few super-tight turns thrown in your way. When there is an obstacle to dodge — a giant rotating fan, crashing logs — you tend to just whiz by, furthering the sense of walking a tightrope. It all adds up to a racer that, like its spiritual predecessors, keeps you constantly engaged. For $15, it’s a pretty good deal too. Just note that there’s no online multiplayer. —<br>Jeff Dunn, Senior Reporter<br>$15 at GameStop<br>Nintendo<br>Super Mario Odyssey<br>With<br>DK taking center stage in the Switch 2&#x27;s first AAA platformer<br>, that means we&#x27;re going to have to wait a bit longer for a new mainline Mario game (<br>Mario Kart World<br>doesn&#x27;t count). But you know that? That&#x27;s ok, because<br>Super Mario Odyssey<br>is still an all-time great title even among an already star-studded franchise.<br>It has one of the best soundtracks of any Mario game (<br>Jump Up, Super Star<br>anyone?) and some of the wildest mechanics. You want to turn Mario into a T-Rex? Sure, why not? How about a Hammer Bro or a Goomba? You got it — and that&#x27;s just the start. And with levels that will take you from the city to an edible wonderland, there&#x27;s no shortage of places to explore. So if somehow you&#x27;ve managed to skip<br>Super Mario Odyssey<br>and are looking to play one of the best 3D platformers ever made, picking this up for the Switch 2 is a no-brainer. And did we mention it runs better on Nintendo&#x27;s latest console, too?<br>— Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter<br>$42 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$59 at Macy&#x27;s<br>$60 at Target<br>Nintendo<br>Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Pokémon Violet<br>Some might have issues with its rigid level scaling or certain areas feeling a bit empty, but if<br>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<br>had come out on the Switch 2 instead of the original Switch, Nintendo could have completely sidestepped one of the title&#x27;s biggest issues: lackluster performance. But thanks to a free update pack for Nintendo&#x27;s latest console, the game runs beautifully. Framerates are higher and more stable, draw distance is farther, monster density has been increased and textures and visuals have been optimized across the board. This is how the game was meant to be experienced all along and with an open world format, three different main storylines and over 100 new Pokémon to encounter,<br>Scarlet and Violet<br>feels like it&#x27;s gotten a second life on the Switch 2.<br>— S.R.<br>$120 at Macy&#x27;s<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$120 at Target<br>$127 at Amazon<br>IO Interactive<br>Hitman: World of Assassination<br>World of Assassination<br>is how the<br>Hitman<br>series packaged together three meaty entries in the death-dealing series, with online limited-run events, celebrities and even an eventual Bond tie-in. Is it the best, smoothest way to play Hitman? No, but while the frame-rate dips when you‘re blending into the crowds at Formula 1, or hiding away in at the fashion show, it’s playable and it looks good. It’s also a good indication of the leap between the two Switch consoles: The original games ran on the Switch, but demanded cloud streaming.<br>IO Interactive put so much attention into building compelling sandbox levels, and you’ll really live in stages like Dartmoor as you figure out the most delightful ways to end your target. Also: there are so many disguises.<br>If you thought three games in one is a lot, this is also the Signature Edition, which folds in even more content, levels and missions. There’s a lot to play through and if, like me, you never quite finished the trilogy, this is a portable, convenient way to wrap up Agent 47’s saga. It also gives the studio plenty of time to refine performance on the Switch 2 ahead of its big Bond title,<br>007 First Light. — M.S.<br>$60 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$60 at Target<br>$64 at Macy&#x27;s<br>CD Projekt<br>Cyberpunk 2077<br>Cyberpunk 2077<br>certainly isn&#x27;t the newest game on this list, but the idea of porting this game over to the original Switch and its outdated hardware is so laughable, CD Projekt Red probably didn&#x27;t even try. But that&#x27;s what makes seeing it run on the Switch 2 so impressive. Sure, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice where some graphics don&#x27;t look quite as good as they would on a high-end PC or PS5. But getting the game to run as smoothly as it does on a system that you can bring pretty much anywhere is no small feat. Plus, the Ultimate Edition version of the game includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which means you&#x27;ll have well over a hundred hours of sci-fi RPG ruckus to engage in.<br>— S.R.<br>$69 at Amazon<br>Explore More Buying Options<br>$70 at Best Buy<br>Check out our entire<br>Best Games series<br>including the<br>best Nintendo Switch games<br>, the<br>best PS5 games<br>, the<br>best Xbox games<br>, the<br>best PC games<br>and the<br>best free games<br>you can play today.<br>Advertisement<br>About our ads</div>
