This achievement highlights Australia&#x27;s political urgency to enhance its defense capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region against the rising threat from China. The project, co-developed and jointly funded by Anduril and Australia, delivered its first prototype ahead of schedule, contrasting sharply with the delayed XLUUV development in the United States. The contract covers delivery, maintenance, and continued development of the platform, which is designed for long-range, stealthy surveillance and strike operations.</div>

While users must still apply to write notes, the new test enables broader participation in rating their helpfulness and requesting notes for potentially incorrect or misleading posts. Additionally, a new notification system will alert users who interact with posts that receive a Community Note. Despite over 70,000 contributors, only six percent of written notes have been published, indicating the feature is still in early stages.</div>

                <div class="summary">Apple
unveiled its new line of iPhones
on Tuesday, and the
iPhone 17 Pro
is making a direct appeal to content creators.
The iPhone camera has long checked all the boxes for anything that a casual user might need, making a digital camera obsolete for most consumers. But for millions of content creators — an industry encompassing an estimated
200 million
potential customers — it has remained necessary to buy handheld video cameras from companies like Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon, and Fujifilm. Some of these camera brands have spun up entire product lines marketed as “vlogging cameras,” featuring pop-out displays to record selfie videos, as well as compatibility with the common dimensions used for social media.
But the iPhone 17 Pro could finally be the device that makes content creators’ other video cameras collect dust.
At a glance, a key difference here is that the new iPhone 17 Pro’s camera sensor is 56% larger than the iPhone 16 Pro’s. The size of a camera sensor impacts most aspects of a camera’s performance, like low-light capabilities, depth of field, and resolution — so, basically, the specs are simply just better on the new device.
But under more scrutiny, the specs remain impressive for a pocketable camera that weighs half a pound. (It still clocks in a tad lighter than the Ricoh GR IIIx, a tiny camera I’ve been eyeing for everyday street photography.) The iPhone 17 Pro’s main, ultra wide, and telephoto lenses are all 48MP fusion cameras, making optical zoom possible at 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x, and 8x. The telephoto lens is a huge improvement from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 12 MP lens, while the selfie camera also improves from 12 MP to 18 MP.
“The wider field of view in higher resolution are particularly useful when recording yourself speaking directly to the camera, making our Pro models the absolute best choice for content creators,” said Patrick Carroll, manager of iPhone camera architecture, during Apple’s presentation.</div>

As hackers exploit a high-severity vulnerability in SAP’s flagship Enterprise Resource Planning software product, the software maker is warning users of more than two dozen newly detected vulnerabilities in its other widely used products, including a security flaw with a maximum-severity rating of 10.
SAP on Tuesday
said
the highest-severity vulnerability—with a rating of 10 out of a possible 10—was found in NetWeaver, a platform that serves as the technical foundation for many of the company’s other enterprise applications. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42944, makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute commands by submitting malicious payloads to an open port.
The maximum-severity threat stems from a deserialization vulnerability. Serialization is a coding process that translates data structures and object states into formats that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. Deserialization is the process in reverse.
In Tuesday’s disclosure, SAP revealed three other high-severity NetWeaver vulnerabilities, with ratings of 9.9, 9.6, and 9.1.
Word of the newly documented vulnerabilities comes five days after security firm SecurityBridge
reported
that a separate high-severity vulnerability SAP patched last month was under active exploitation in the wild. That vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-42957 and carrying a severity rating of 9.</div>

Apple
just announced
AirPods Pro 3
(along with lots of other stuff – read
everything Apple announced at its iPhone 17 event here
), and as part of the announcement it showed off a new Live Translation feature.
This takes the speech of someone speaking to you in another language and converts it to your own language in your ears via your AirPods. You can speak back, and your iPhone will show what you&#x27;re saying in their language. If two people are both using AirPods, you can just talk and have the whole conversation translated.
Here&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s demo of Live Translation:

Now, you might assume (as I initially did) that this is an AirPods Pro 3 exclusive, since Apple doesn&#x27;t mention it coming to any other earbuds – but it&#x27;s not. Apple&#x27;s language is ambiguous during the section, and looking at the comparison pages for different AirPods models after the event reveals that more models will get this feature.
Specifically, it&#x27;s the
AirPods Pro 2
and
AirPods 4 with ANC
that will get it.</div>

Sage is looking sharp.
Apple’s big fall event just wrapped up, and we rushed out of the Steve Jobs Theater to get our hands on the latest iPhones. Here’s a look at the
new iPhone 17
, Apple’s base model this year, which is joined by the thinner
iPhone Air
and beefier
iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max
— there’s no Plus this time around.
The first place to start is the rear camera. Not because a lot has changed here, but rather because it hasn’t: while the iPhone 17 Pro and Air have both adopted new horizontal camera “plateaus,” the regular 17 has the same two vertically stacked lenses as last year. That means this is the only iPhone 17 that actually looks like the
iPhone 16 range
— which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on your perspective.

Apple gives iPhone 14 and 15 owners an extra free year of satellite connectivity
It&#x27;s the free trial that (seemingly) never ends.

Apple
Tucked away in Apple&#x27;s
iPhone 17
press releases was a bonus for off-grid owners of older models. The company gave iPhone 14 and 15 owners free access to satellite features for another year. This is Apple&#x27;s
third extension
since Emergency SOS via satellite
launched with the iPhone 14
.
&quot;The free trial will be extended for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users who have activated their device in a country that supports Apple&#x27;s satellite features prior to 12AM PT on September 9, 2025,&quot; the company&#x27;s copy
reads
. An Apple support page
lists
Armenia, Belarus, China mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Russia as unsupported countries.
Apple&#x27;s off-grid feature set began in 2022 with Emergency SOS via satellite. In iOS 18, it expanded to include
Messages via satellite
, Find My access and roadside assistance. The features work through a partnership with Globalstar.
Apple
As for why Apple keeps extending the free access, a Redditor floated a logical-sounding theory after last year&#x27;s announcement. &quot;I can&#x27;t see Apple ever charging for [Emergency SOS via satellite],&quot; u/rotates-potatoes
posted
. &quot;The positive PR of &#x27;saved by Apple&#x27; is too good, and the negative PR of &#x27;died because they didn&#x27;t pay $3&#x27; is too bad.&quot; (It&#x27;s worth noting that the pricing was speculative. Apple hasn&#x27;t said how much it plans to charge.)

You can demo the features on your iPhone right now. To test Emergency SOS, head to
Settings &gt; Emergency SOS
, and scroll down to &quot;Try Demo&quot; (at the bottom). For the texting feature, go to
Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Messages
, and scroll down to &quot;Satellite Connection Demo.&quot;
