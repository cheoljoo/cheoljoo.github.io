                <div class="summary">India has 100 million weekly active ChatGPT users, making the country one of OpenAI’s largest markets globally, CEO Sam Altman said ahead of a government-hosted AI summit.
On Sunday, Altman outlined ChatGPT’s growing adoption in India in an article
published
in the Indian English daily Times of India, as OpenAI prepares to formally participate in the five-day India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, beginning Monday. Altman is
attending the event
alongside senior executives from several of the world’s leading AI companies.
The growth comes as OpenAI,
like other leading AI firms
, looks to India’s young population and its more than a billion internet users to fuel global expansion. The ChatGPT maker
opened a New Delhi office
in August 2025 after months of groundwork in the country, and has adjusted its approach for India’s price-sensitive market, including rolling out a
sub-$5 ChatGPT Go tier
that was
later made free for a year
for Indian users.
In the article, Altman said India is ChatGPT’s second-largest user base after the United States, highlighting the South Asian nation’s growing weight in OpenAI’s global strategy. The disclosure comes as ChatGPT’s overall usage has surged worldwide, with the platform
reaching 800 million weekly active users
as of October 2025 and reported to be
approaching 900 million
.
Altman also highlighted the role of students in driving adoption, saying India has the largest number of student users of ChatGPT globally.
Indian students have become a key growth segment for leading AI companies more broadly, as rivals race to embed their tools in classrooms and learning workflows. Google has similarly targeted the market, offering Indian students a
free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan
in September 2025. Separately, India accounts for the
highest global usage of Gemini for learning
, Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, said last month.

Nvidia, Groq and the limestone race to real-time AI: Why enterprises win or lose here
Andrew Filev, Zencoder
February 15, 2026

​From miles away across the desert, the Great Pyramid looks like a perfect, smooth geometry — a sleek triangle pointing to the stars. Stand at the base, however, and the illusion of smoothness vanishes. You see massive, jagged blocks of limestone. It is not a slope; it is a staircase.
​Remember this the next time you hear futurists talking about exponential growth.
​Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore (Moore&#x27;s Law) is famously quoted for saying in 1965 that the transistor count on a microchip would double every year. Another Intel executive, David House, later revised this statement to “compute power doubling every 18 months.&quot; For a while, Intel’s CPUs were the poster child of this law. That is, until the growth in CPU performance flattened out like a block of limestone.
​If you zoom out, though, the next limestone block was already there — the growth in compute merely shifted from CPUs to the world of GPUs. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, played a long game and came out a strong winner, building his own stepping stones initially with gaming, then computer visioniand recently, generative AI.
​The illusion of smooth growth
​Technology growth is full of sprints and plateaus, and gen AI is not immune. The current wave is driven by transformer architecture. To quote Anthropic’s President and co-founder Dario Amodei: “The exponential continues until it doesn’t. And every year we’ve been like, ‘Well, this can’t possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential’ — and then every year it has.”
​But just as the CPU plateaued and GPUs took the lead, we are seeing signs that LLM growth is shifting paradigms again. For example, late in 2024, DeepSeek surprised the world by training a world-class model on an impossibly small budget, in part by using the MoE technique.

On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.
That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.
Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.
We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.

You need to watch the intensely surreal cult classic Possession
It features three of the most unhinged performances in cinema history, and I mean that as a compliment.

Let me just say that I
highly

blind. Don’t watch a trailer. Don’t even finish reading this. Go watch it now over on
Shudder

Criterion

Metrograph
. It’s also available through
Kanopy
or
Hoopla
if your library provides access. Then come back so we can talk about it in the comments. Though this probably isn’t one for the squeamish.
Warning: Spoilers ahead.
Possession
is the sort of film that, even if you’ve had the whole plot spoiled for you, can be difficult to follow. After watching it twice, listening to three different podcasts, and reading multiple articles about it, I’m still n</div>

Apple may be adding a splash of color to its upcoming budget-friendly MacBook
We could see the next low-cost MacBooks in light yellow or light green, according to the latest Bloomberg report.

The hardest choice to make for building your next MacBook might be selecting a color. According to
Bloomberg
&#x27;s Mark Gurman, Apple has tested colors including light yellow, light green, blue and pink for its next entry-level MacBook that&#x27;s aimed at students and enterprise users.
Beyond the more vibrant colors, Gurman said that Apple has also trialed its classic silver and dark gray colorways for its cheaper laptop. Gurman added that not all of these six colors will make it to the final product, but Apple has recently shown it&#x27;s not afraid to dip into flashier options. Apple refreshed the
iMac
in 2024 with a total of seven colors and swapped out the space gray option for sky blue for the latest
MacBook Air
.
Color choices aside, the latest rumors point to the upcoming MacBook having a price tag that&#x27;s anywhere between $699 and $799. To achieve that lower price point, Apple is expected to port over its chips designed for iPhones, like the A18 Pro that we first saw with the
iPhone 16 Pro Max
. We&#x27;re also anticipating Apple will compromise on specs, ports, or even the display, but Gurman reported that the company won&#x27;t be skimping when it comes to the shell. According to Gurman, Apple will employ a new manufacturing process to craft aluminum shells for the affordable MacBook, instead of opting for a cheaper material like plastic to cut costs. We may not have to wait long to see the official colors of the budget MacBook, as Gurman reported that it will be announced during an event in March.

                <div class="summary">Louis Rosenberg of Unanimous A.I. discusses the challenge of leveraging collective intelligence in large teams, noting that productive real-time conversations typically don&#x27;t scale beyond 4-7 people. He argues that traditional methods like polls and surveys fail to capture the deliberative process necessary for optimal solutions and for individuals to feel heard. Rosenberg advocates for authentic real-time conversations at scale as the best way to unlock the true collective intelligence of large teams, contrasting surveys as treating people as &quot;data points&quot; versus interactive conversations treating them as &quot;thoughtful data processors&quot;.
