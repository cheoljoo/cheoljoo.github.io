                <div class="summary">Microsoft has cut off the Israel Ministry of Defense’s access to some of its tech and services after an internal investigation found the organization appeared to be using its tech to store surveillance data on phone calls made by Palestinians.
The tech giant announced on Thursday that it made the decision to “cease and disable” certain subscriptions from the Israeli military. This affects subscriptions to Azure cloud storage and certain AI services.
“We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,” Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a
blog post
. “We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft’s standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians.”
Microsoft informed Israel of its decision last week, according to
The Guardian
.
The decision follows Microsoft’s ongoing review of the matter, which started in August. The investigation was sparked by a story in
The Guardian
that reported that Unit 8200, the elite Israel military intelligence unit, was using Azure cloud storage to house data on phone calls obtained through the surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
In his blog post, Smith also said the company appreciated The Guardian’s initial reporting. Smith wrote that without it, they wouldn’t have known to look into the matter, as due to customer privacy rights, they can’t access a customer’s content.
“As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust,” Smith wrote.

Study: Planned budget cuts would hurt drug development badly
Drug patents frequently cite research that the NIH wouldn&#x27;t be able to fund.

The proposed federal budget
would see drastic cuts
made to most of the agencies that fund science. The sheer magnitude of the cuts—including a 40 percent slashing of money going to the National Institutes of Health—would do severe harm to biomedical researchers and the industries that serve or rely on them. And, ultimately, that is likely to do harm to all of us.
In today&#x27;s issue of Science, some researchers have attempted to put numbers on those indirect effects that fall within that &quot;ultimately&quot; category. They&#x27;ve identified which grants wouldn&#x27;t have been funded had similar cuts been made earlier in this century and tracked the impact that likely had on drug patents. Their conclusion: Development of roughly half the newly approved drugs relied on work that was funded by a grant that would need to be cut.
From grants to drugs
It&#x27;s uncertain whether the proposed budget cuts will go through. At the moment, Congress is
looking to fund most science agencies
at levels similar to their current budgets. Should cuts eventually happen, then it&#x27;s also difficult to predict how they&#x27;ll be spread among the more than 20 institutes that make up the NIH (a number that the administration also wants to see reduced via consolidation). So, the researchers make a big simplifying assumption: Every institute within the NIH will take a 40 percent hit to its budget.
From there, it actually becomes simple to identify the grants that would be dropped as a result of these budget cuts. That&#x27;s because the NIH operates a system in which each grant submission gets a priority score after evaluation and discussion. Grants are then f...</div>

Report warns attackers can intercept API calls on iOS devices, and make them appear legitimate
Traditional security tools fail to protect apps against in-device attacks
Compromised mobile devices significantly increase the risk of API exploitation
New research from
Zimperium
has claimed mobile apps are now the primary battleground for API-based attacks, creating serious risks of fraud and data theft for enterprises.
The research shows 1 in 3 Android apps and more than half of iOS apps leak sensitive data, offering attackers direct access to business-critical systems.
Even more worrying the report claims three of every 1,000 mobile devices arealready infected, with 1 in 5 Android devices encountering malware in the wild.

You wouldn’t skip handwashing – so why skip mobile security hygiene?
The scale of mobile API vulnerabilities
Unlike web applications, mobile apps ship API endpoints and calling logic onto untrusted devices, exposing them to potential tampering and reverse-engineering.
This allows attackers to intercept traffic, modify the app, and make malicious API calls appear legitimate.
Traditional defenses such as
firewalls
, gateways, proxies, and API key validation cannot fully protect against these in-app threats.
“APIs don’t just power mobile apps, they expose them,” said Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product solutions at Zimperium.

Microsoft is making advances with a new way to cool microchips that it says could lead to more energy-efficient data centers in the future. It’s a method called microfluidics that involves liquid coolant flowing directly into the silicon.
After lab tests, Microsoft found that this strategy can remove heat up to three times better than cold plates currently used in data centers today. The company announced this week tha...</div>

Google asks Supreme Court to rescue it from its Epic lawsuit

Google is asking the Supreme Court to step in and pause the ruling the company received in its lawsuit with Epic Games, according to
a filing
the company shared with Engadget. The company is making its request following
a major legal loss to Epic Games
in October 2024, which required it to open the Google Play Store to third-party app stores for a period of three years.
Google is asking the justices to intervene by October 17, three days before the injunction Epic won starts to go into effect. The company hopes that after offering a stay, the Court will take up the case for a full review. Asking the Supreme Court for relief wouldn&#x27;t have even entered the picture if Google&#x27;s appeal hadn&#x27;t already been
denied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
. The company&#x27;s filing includes multiple technical reasons why the Ninth Circuit Court&#x27;s ruling should be overturned. It also offers several examples why the original injunction Epic won is bad for Google, developers and consumers.
Google believes the injunction &quot;[creates] enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive or pirated content to proliferate,” and that it burdens developers with &quot;constantly monitoring dozens or hundreds of stores that might suddenly carry their apps without their knowledge.&quot; The company also notes that the injunction will make it &quot;substantially easier for developers to avoid compensating Google,&quot; for Play Store services that have nothing to do with payments.

                <div class="summary">Meta announced on Monday that it’s bringing
an AI assistant
to Facebook Dating.
This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile.
Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm.
The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year growth, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about
50 million daily active users
, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users.
AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like
Sitch
have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features.
Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a
partnership
with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the
financial struggles
of Match Group, which has lost about
68%
of its stock price in the last five years.
So far, this investment has produced features like an
AI photo selector
tool to Tinder, which scans your cameral roll to help choose profile images, as well as
AI-powered matching
. Hinge has a feature that lets users
improve their responses
to profile prompts with AI.

On Monday, OpenAI and Nvidia jointly
announced
a letter of intent for a strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI&#x27;s AI infrastructure, with Nvidia planning to invest up to $100 billion as the systems roll out. The companies said the first gigawatt of Nvidia systems will come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia&#x27;s
Vera Rubin
platform.
&quot;Everything starts with compute,&quot; said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in the announcement. &quot;Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we&#x27;re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.&quot;
The 10-gigawatt project represents an astoundingly ambitious and as-yet-unproven scale for AI infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
told
CNBC that the planned 10 gigawatts equals the power consumption of between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, which matches the company&#x27;s total GPU shipments for this year and doubles last year&#x27;s volume. &quot;This is a giant project,&quot; Huang said in an interview alongside Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.
To put that power demand in perspective, 10 gigawatts equals the output of
roughly
10 nuclear reactors, which typically output about 1 gigawatt per facility. Current data center energy consumption
ranges
from 10 megawatts to 1 gigawatt, with most large facilities consuming between 50 and 100 megawatts.</div>

Questyle QCC Dongle Pro: Two-minute review
You may not realise it, but your phone and your wireless headphones don’t always agree on how good your music should sound. It’s a question of compatibility, and it can be a thorny issue.
Bluetooth audio codecs are the invisible lines of code that translate your music (whether streamed from a subscription service or stored locally on your phone) into something that can be transmitted wirelessly to your headphones, earbuds, or portable speakers.
All Bluetooth products support SBC, a codec that provides basic &#x27;vanilla&#x27; audio quality, but when it comes to high-quality advanced codecs, like LDAC and
aptX Adaptive
(which preserve far more of your music’s detail), it’s the wild west out there. Some Android handsets support both. Some just support one. iPhones (in fact, all
Apple
devices) support neither.</div>

Steam has taken down a game containing malware that drained the cryptocurrency wallets belonging to hundreds of players, as reported
earlier by
Bleeping Computer
. The free-to-play 2D platformer, titled
BlockBlasters
, took
more than $150,000
from victims, including $32,000 from a streamer raising funds for their cancer treatment.
In a post on X, malware tracker vx-underground revealed that bad actors targeted some streamers with a spearphishing campaign that attempted to lure victims into
promoting the game
in exchange for compensation. “Unfortunately, the Steam game was actually a cryptodrainer masquerading as a legitimate video game,” vx-underground wrote in a post on X.</div>

Perplexity Email Assistant
(Perplexity)
Perplexity has
introduced
a new feature dubbed Email Assistant. With this resource, users can direct an AI chatbot to execute basic email tasks such as scheduling meetings, organizing and prioritizing emails, and drafting replies. At launch, Gmail and Outlook are the only supported email clients.
Email assistant is only available to members of the company&#x27;s pricey Max plan, which costs $200 a month. Perplexity
added
this upscale subscription option in July. Once an Max user has signed up for the feature, they can write to Perplexity&#x27;s assistant email address to access its capabilities. Although the company emphasized that the AI assistant does not train on a user&#x27;s emails, it does adopt their writing style when drafting replies. The feature is available starting today.
