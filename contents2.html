announced
on Wednesday a new integration with Spotify, bringing a seamless ticket-buying experience for Spotify users. Now, when Spotify users browse an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates, they will see ticket links powered by SeatGeek for concerts at these participating venues, allowing for a streamlined purchase process. Currently, the integration is available for a select group of venues where SeatGeek serves as the primary ticket seller. Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)
This is a strategic win for SeatGeek. With direct placement in the Spotify app, SeatGeek is positioned to reach millions of active music fans as they discover upcoming events, increasing the chances of converting listeners into ticket buyers. Image Credits:
SeatGeek
Although SeatGeek has made significant strides in the space, it continues to face competition from heavyweights Ticketmaster and AXS. These rivals command a greater share of the ticketing market, bolstered by long-term contracts with many top venues and event organizers. It’s
estimated
that Ticketmaster alone services 53 of the top 68 US arenas. Even Barclays Center, which switched from Ticketmaster to SeatGeek in 2021,
quickly reversed course
less than a year into a seven-year agreement and ended the deal to return to Ticketmaster. Notably, the latest partnership follows Spotify’s
announcement
that it has helped artists generate over $1 billion in ticket sales by linking fans with live events through its ticketing partners. The company works with more than 45
ticketing partners
, including Ticketmaster, AXS, Eventbrite, DICE, a...</div>

Alibaba dropped Qwen3.5
earlier this week, timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year, and the headline numbers alone are enough to make enterprise AI buyers stop and pay attention. The new flagship open-weight model — Qwen3.5-397B-A17B — packs 397 billion total parameters but activates only 17 billion per token. It is claiming benchmark wins against
Alibaba&#x27;s own previous flagship, Qwen3-Max
, a model the company itself has acknowledged exceeded one trillion parameters. The release marks a meaningful moment in enterprise AI procurement. For IT leaders evaluating AI infrastructure for 2026, Qwen 3.5 presents a different kind of argument: that the model you can actually run, own, and control can now trade blows with the models you have to rent. A New Architecture Built for Speed at Scale
The engineering story underneath Qwen3.5 starts with its ancestry. The model is a direct successor to last September&#x27;s experimental Qwen3-Next, an ultra-sparse MoE model that was previewed but widely regarded as half-trained. Qwen3.5 takes that architectural direction and scales it aggressively, jumping from 128 experts in the previous Qwen3 MoE models to 512 experts in the new release. The practical implication of this and a better attention mechanism is dramatically lower inference latency. Because only 17 billion of those 397 billion parameters are active for any given forward pass, the compute footprint is far closer to a 17B dense model than a 400B one — while the model can draw on the full depth of its expert pool for specialized reasoning. These speed gains are substantial. At 256K context lengths, Qwen 3.5 decodes 19 times faster than Qwen3-Max and 7.2 times faster than Qwen 3&#x27;s 235B-A22B model.</div>

This week, Apple released the first developer betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, macOS 26.4, and its other operating systems. On Tuesday, it followed those up with public beta versions of the same updates. Usually released around the midpoint between one major iOS release and the next, the *.4 updates to its operating system usually include a significant batch of new features and other refinements, and if the first beta is any indication, this year’s releases uphold that tradition. A new “Playlist Playground” feature will let Apple Music subscribers generate playlists with text prompts, and native support for video podcasts is coming to the Podcasts app. The
Creator Studio version
of the Freeform drawing and collaboration app is also available in the 26.4 updates, allowing subscribers to access stock images from Apple’s Content Hub and to insert AI-generated images. But we’ve spent time digging through the betas to identify some of the more below-the-surface improvements and changes that Apple is testing. Some of these changes won’t come to the public versions of the software until a later release; others may be removed or changed between now and when the 26.4 update is made available to the general public. But generally, Apple’s betas give us a good idea of what the final release will look like. One feature that hasn’t appeared in these betas? The new “more intelligent Siri” that ...</div>

AirPods Max
and
AirPods 4

AirPods Pro 3
. And while more recent shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday delivered some of the steepest discounts we’ve seen, there are still good deals to be found on every model. Related

Cyberpunk platformer Replaced has once again been delayed
It&#x27;s now scheduled to come out on April 14. Lawrence Bonk

The long-awaited cyberpunk platformer
Replaced
just got hit with a short delay
. The pixel-art game
was supposed to come out on March 12
, but will now be released on April 14. That&#x27;s just a month, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal considering this game has been
on our radar for five years
. Why the delay? Developer Sad Cat Studios notes that the game is &quot;technically finished&quot; but the team needs a few more weeks for polish. The company says it wants the day-one release to be &quot;polished, stable and true to the vision&quot; of the original concept. This is something to be commended, in my opinion,
given the sad state
of many game launches
in recent years
. This is just the
latest delay for the game
. However, previous delays have been for a very good reason. The development team had to relocate from Belarus to Cyprus after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Advertisement

Replaced
is an absolutely gorgeous-looking 2.5D platformer set in a dystopian alternative 1980s America. You play as an AI unwillingly trapped in a human body. There looks to be plenty of cinematic action, with a blurb promising a combination of &quot;precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks.&quot;
The game will be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG and the Microsoft Store. It&#x27;ll also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass release. Advertisement

                <div class="summary">Gabriel Vasquez, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, recently revealed he took nine flights from NYC to Stockholm in one year. While his visits included stops at companies like Lovable — where he posted from its office — the trips were also about finding future Swedish unicorns before they cross the Atlantic. This all came to light when news emerged that a16z had led a $2.3 million pre-seed round into Dentio , a Swedish startup that uses AI to help dentists’ practices with admin work. While this is a small check for a firm that just announced new funds totaling $15 billion , it confirms that U.S. VCs are actively seeking deal flow outside of the U.S., even without local offices. Stockholm is a natural stop for a16z, which previously achieved significant returns from backing Skype, cofounded by Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennström. Since then, a significant number of fast-growing startups have been created in the Swedish capital, and the VC heavyweight tracked down where many of them were coming from. “We spend a lot of time developing a deep understanding of specific markets and knowing where innovation is emerging. In Sweden, that has meant closely tracking ecosystems like SSE Labs — the startup incubator of the Stockholm School of Economics — and the companies coming out of it,” Vasquez told TechCrunch. Like fintech giant Klarna, legal AI startup Legora, and e-scooter company Voi, Dentio is an alum of SSE Labs — a startup incubator that has produced several successful Swedish companies. The three former high school classmates Elias Afrasiabi, Anton Li and Lukas Sjögren joined the incubator after reconnecting as students at both the SSE (Stockholm School of Economics) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), then joined the incubator with additional backing from KTH’s Innovation Launch program . They tackled a problem close to home: Li’s mom, a dentist, had told them how admin work detracted from clinical care. The trio intuited that they could leverage LLMs to help</div>

                <div class="summary">Most ransomware playbooks don&#x27;t address machine credentials. Attackers know it. Louis Columbus February 16, 2026 The gap between ransomware threats and the defenses meant to stop them is getting worse, not better. Ivanti’s 2026 State of Cybersecurity Report found that the preparedness gap widened by an average of 10 points year over year across every threat category the firm tracks. Ransomware hit the widest spread: 63% of security professionals rate it a high or critical threat, but just 30% say they are “very prepared” to defend against it. That’s a 33-point gap, up from 29 points a year ago. CyberArk’s 2025 Identity Security Landscape puts numbers to the problem: 82 machine identities for every human in organizations worldwide. Forty-two percent of those machine identities have privileged or sensitive access. The most authoritative playbook framework has the same blind spot Gartner’s ransomware preparation guidance, the April 2024 research note “How to Prepare for Ransomware Attacks” that enterprise security teams reference when building incident response procedures, specifically calls out the need to reset “impacted user/host credentials” during containment. The accompanying Ransomware Playbook Toolkit walks teams through four phases: containment, analysis, remediation, and recovery. The credential reset step instructs teams to ensure all affected user and device accounts are reset. Service accounts are absent. So are API keys, tokens, and certificates. The most widely used playbook framework in enterprise security stops at human and device credentials. The organizations following it inherit that blind spot without realizing it. The same research note identifies the problem without connecting it to the solution. Gartner warns that “poor identity and access management (IAM) practices” remain a primary starting point for ransomware attacks, and that previously compromised credentials are being used to gain access through initial access brokers and dark web data du</div>

The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement. Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was “hijacking” its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were “free public domain clip art,” Axios reported . “ByteDance’s virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP is willful, pervasive, and totally unacceptable,” Disney’s letter said. Defending intellectual property from franchises like Star Trek and The Godfather , Paramount Skydance pointed out that Seedance’s outputs are “often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from the original characters, Variety reported . Similarly frustrated, Japan’s AI minister Kimi Onoda, sought to protect popular anime and manga characters, officially launching a probe last week into ByteDance over the copyright violations, the South China Morning Post reported . “We cannot overlook a situation in which content is being used without the copyright holder’s permission</div>
