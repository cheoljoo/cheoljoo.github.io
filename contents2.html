As LLMs have continued to improve, there has been some discussion in the industry about the continued need for standalone data labeling tools, as LLMs are increasingly able to work with all types of data.
HumanSignal,
the lead commercial vendor behind the open-source Label Studio program, has a different view. Rather than seeing less demand for data labeling, the company is seeing more.
Earlier this month, HumanSignal acquired Erud AI and launched its physical Frontier Data Labs for novel data collection. But creating data is only half the challenge. Today, the company is tackling what comes next: proving the AI systems trained on that data actually work. The new multi-modal agent evaluation capabilities let enterprises validate complex AI agents generating applications, images, code,  and video.
&quot;If you focus on the enterprise segments, then all of the AI solutions that they&#x27;re building still need to be evaluated, which is just another word for data labeling by humans and even more so by experts,&quot; HumanSignal co-founder and CEO Michael Malyuk told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview.
The intersection of data labeling and agentic AI evaluation
Having the right data is great, but that&#x27;s not the end goal for an enterprise. Where modern data labeling is headed is evaluation.
It&#x27;s a fundamental shift in what enterprises need validated: not whether their model correctly classified an image, but whether their AI agent made good decisions across a complex, multi-step task involving reasoning, tool usage and code generation.
If evaluation is just data labeling for AI outputs, then the shift from models to agents represents a step change in what needs to be labeled.</div>

For months, the Trump administration has warned that semiconductor tariffs are coming soon, leaving the tech industry on pins and needles after a chaotic year of unpredictable tariff regimes collectively cost firms billions.
The semiconductor tariffs are key to Donald Trump’s economic agenda, which is intended to force more manufacturing into the US by making it more expensive to import materials and products. He
campaigned on axing the CHIPS Act
—which provided subsidies to companies investing in manufacturing chips in the US—complaining that it was a “horrible, horrible thing” to “give hundreds of billions of dollars” away when the US could achieve the same objective by instead taxing companies and “use whatever is left over” of CHIPS funding to “reduce debt.” However, as 2025 winds down, the US president faces pressure on all sides to delay semiconductor tariffs, insiders
told Reuters
, and it appears that he is considering caving.
According to “two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations,” US officials have privately told industry and government stakeholders that semiconductor tariffs will likely be delayed.
A fourth insider suggested Trump was hesitant to impose tariffs that could rock the
recent US-China trade truce
, while Reuters noted that Trump may also be hesitant to announce new tariffs during the holiday shopping season that risk increasing prices of popular consumer tech products.</div>

In Kirby Air Riders, expression is more fun than racing
Why race when there’s fashion to be made?

Hear me out:
Kirby Air Riders
isn’t a racing game, it’s an art tool with a racing game tacked on.
The game, out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, is the follow-up to the quirky Kirby-flavored kart racer released in 2003 on the GameCube. It features
Smash Bros.
creator Masahiro Sakurai
’s
round, pink, utterly charming
child participating in short races where the main feature isn’t so much about how fast you go, but how well you can manage the winding courses while fighting the cutest rogues’ gallery ever committed to polygons.

Once again, my theory that Nintendo releases a Kirby game when things are bad, has proven correct.
Unlike in other kart racers,
Air Riders
has no acceleration button. Instead you’re automatically propelled forward, requiring you to negotiate the track with the brake button that you can use to drift around corners.</div>

Australia is adding Twitch to its social media ban for children
The world&#x27;s first ban of its kind goes into effect next month.

The breadth and reach of Australia&#x27;s
pioneering social media ban
grows as livestream platform Twitch has now been added to the list of banned platforms for users under 16 years of age. The nationwide ban is the first of its kind and encompasses Facebook, X, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube and recently
Reddit
.
According to the
BBC
, Australia&#x27;s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said Twitch had been included because it was &quot;a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted.&quot;
No other platforms are expected to be added before the law goes into effect next month. Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest would not be included in the ban because the core purpose of the platform was not online social interaction.

Under the ban, platforms are expected to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to prevent underage users from accessing their platforms, and face steep fees for failure to comply. While
VPNs
may provide a workaround in some instances, the law still creates an enormous barrier to entry for users under 16.
Earlier this month,
Denmark announced
its lawmakers had reached a bipartisan agreement to enact a similar ban for users under 15, though details were scarce. In the US, several states have attempted to enact such a ban including
Texas
and
Florida
, though these measures either failed to pass or are held up in court. Even laws that don&#x27;t go as far, such as
Utah&#x27;s law
requiring parents to grant permission for teens to open social media accounts, are facing stiff opposition on First Amendment grounds.</div>

                <div class="summary">Kalshi, a prediction market that allows people to bet on future events, has raised a massive $1 billion round at a $11 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the deal. The round comes less than two months after the seven-year-old startup announced its previous fundraise of $300 million at a
$5 billion valuation
.
The latest round is led by the company’s returning investors Sequoia and CapitalG, the person said. Other investors in Kalshi include Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo.
Kalshi and Sequoia declined to comment. Capital G didn’t respond to our request for comment.
Kalshi’s main rival, Polymarket, was reportedly in talks last month to raise another funding round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, mere weeks after closing a $1 billion round at an
$8 billion pre-money valuation
, Bloomberg reported.
Kalshi and Polymarket surged in popularity last year after both prediction markets allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election. These betting sites became even more prominent after they correctly predicted the results of New York City’s mayoral election earlier this month.
For the Mamdani versus Cuomo race, Kalshi purchased ad space on New York subway cars, running live screens that displayed the up-to-the-minute odds of each candidate winning, a marketing campaign that undoubtedly raised the company’s brand awareness among New Yorkers.
Kalshi allows people in over 140 countries to bet on various future events, ranging from who Time Magazine will name Person of the Year for 2025 and the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film Wicked, to outcomes further in the future, like the next U.S. Presidential election winner.

Google&#x27;s upgraded Nano Banana Pro AI image model hailed as &#x27;absolutely bonkers&#x27; for enterprises and users

Infographics rendered without a single spelling error. Complex diagrams one-shotted from paragraph prompts. Logos restored from fragments. And visual outputs so sharp with so much text density and accuracy, one developer simply called it “absolutely bonkers.”
Google DeepMind’s
newly released Nano Banana Pro
—officially Gemini 3 Pro Image—has drawn astonishment from both the developer community and enterprise AI engineers.
But behind the viral praise lies something more transformative: a model built not just to impress, but to integrate deeply across Google’s AI stack—from Gemini API and Vertex AI to Workspace apps, Ads, and Google AI Studio.
Unlike earlier image models, which targeted casual users or artistic use cases, Gemini 3 Pro Image introduces studio-quality, multimodal image generation for structured workflows—with high resolution, multilingual accuracy, layout consistency, and real-time knowledge grounding. It’s engineered for technical buyers, orchestration teams, and enterprise-scale automation, not just creative exploration.
Benchmarks already show the model outperforming peers in overall visual quality, infographic generation, and text rendering accuracy. And as real-world users push it to its limits—from medical illustrations to AI memes—the model is revealing itself as both a new creative tool and a visual reasoning system for the enterprise stack.
Built for Structured Multimodal Reasoning
Gemini 3 Pro Image isn’t just drawing pretty pictures—it’s leveraging the reasoning layer of Gemini 3 Pro to generate visuals that communicate structure, intent, and factual grounding.</div>

President Trump is considering an executive order that would require the federal government to file lawsuits against states with AI laws, and prevent states with AI laws from obtaining broadband funding.
The draft order, “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” would order the attorney general to “establish an AI Litigation Task Force whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General’s judgment.”
The draft order says the Trump administration “will act to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard—not 50 discordant State ones.” It specifically names laws enacted by California and Colorado and directs the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate whether other laws should be challenged.
“That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” the draft order says.</div>

As sure as night follows day, I&#x27;m here to recommend one of my favorite
Black Friday deals
: it&#x27;s the
iPad mini on sale for $399 (was $499) at Amazon US
.
•
Shop Amazon&#x27;s full Black sale
With $100 knocked off the price of
Apple
&#x27;s smallest tablet, it&#x27;s about $20 shy of its cheapest-ever price. But don&#x27;t let that put you off, as the cash saved in this deal is ideal for splashing on a premium app collection or some games that work well on the compact tablet.

Save $100
Apple iPad mini 8.3-inch (A17 Pro, 2024):
was $499
now $399
at Amazon
If you&#x27;re after a smaller iPad, Amazon&#x27;s Black Friday sale has knocked a huge $100 off the price of the A17 Pro-powered iPad mini. We did see this tablet drop to $379 during Prime Day, but $399 is still an exceptional deal price. You can choose from all four colorways, and similar discounts are available on the 256GB and 512GB variants. In our
Apple iPad mini A17 Pro (2024) review
, we praised the new tablet&#x27;s &quot;pocket-friendly design&quot; and &quot;ability to support Apple Intelligence.&quot;

Anyone who&#x27;s read my articles over the past couple of years at TechRadar will probably have a good feeling for my love of the iPad mini. I&#x27;ve owned several generations of the tablet and currently use a mini with the home button-less design on a near-daily basis.
It works well as a note-taking device, e-reader, web browser, streaming machine, and even a bit of a games console. And I can count the times I&#x27;ve traveled without an iPad mini on one hand. It&#x27;s honestly such a lovely little tablet.</div>
