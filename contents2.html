                <div class="summary">Hyundai’s electric air taxi startup Supernal has paused work on its aircraft program after a rocky few months that saw staff cuts and the departure of its CEO and CTO, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The shakeup comes at a time when Supernal has barely gotten off the ground — literally. The first test flight of its technology demonstrator
happened earlier this year
. And though Supernal has performed subsequent tests, the company was still working toward its first untethered test flight before the pause. The company had planned to launch a commercial service in 2028. Supernal announced the departure of CEO Jaiwon Shin late last week. David McBride, the CTO, has also left, according to people familiar, who were granted anonymity to speak about private company matters. The OC Register
first reported
the pause on Supernal’s flight program and McBride’s departure. With regards to the commercial service, the startup told TechCrunch that the “newly appointed leadership will assess and determine the optimal timeline moving forward.” The company declined to comment on McBride leaving. Supernal’s struggles come as the nascent electric air taxi industry is in a period of upheaval. Some startups, like Toyota-backed Joby, have been
raising and announcing partnerships and acquisitions
. Others, like Lillium, have
gone out of business
. Spun out of the Hyundai Group in 2021, Supernal
laid off dozens
earlier this summer ahead of the executive shakeup. That followed the startup abruptly winding down its still-new Washington, D.C. headquarters late last year, as
TechCrunch previously reported

Today, Porsche debuted a new 911 variant at the IAA Mobility show in Munich, Germany. It&#x27;s the most powerful 911 to date, excluding some limited-run models, and may well be the quickest to 60 mph from a standing start, dispatching that dash in just 2.4 seconds. And it&#x27;s all thanks to one of the most interesting hybrid powertrains on sale today. Rather than just bolting an electric motor to an existing 911, Porsche designed an entirely new 3.6 L flat-six engine, taking the opportunity to ditch the belt drive and move some of the ancillaries, which can instead be powered by the car&#x27;s 400 V traction battery. The system debuted in the 911 GTS T-Hybrid,
which Ars recently reviewed
. For that car, Porsche added a single electric turbocharger, which works like the MGU-H in a Formula 1 car. It spins up almost instantly to 120,000 rpm to eliminate throttle lag, but also recaptures excess energy from the spinning turbine and sends that to the 1.9 kWh battery pack. The result is a turbocharged engine that has a remarkable throttle response that&#x27;s more like an EV, with no perceptible lag between initial tip-in and power being delivered to the wheels. For the 2026 911 Turbo S, there are a pair of these electric turbochargers.</div>

XCY X108 can theoretically handle 204TB inside a shoebox-sized case
Intel’s N150 processor delivers modest performance with low power draw
Eight SATA bays allow configurations scaling far beyond 144TB storage
The XCY X108 is an unusually compact network-attached storage system designed to provide very high capacity in a small enclosure. It supports up to eight 3.5-inch bays, which at 18TB each provide 144TB of capacity, or considerably more with newer 30TB and 36TB drives. When combined with additional M.2 slots, the total theoretical capacity reaches 204TB, putting it close to the
largest HDD
arrays available in devices of this size. You may like
Kiwi storage startup uses proprietary 144TB SSD to hit 230PB storage per 42U rack - but it will cost well over $2 million to get such a system
This tiny NAS can store up to 32TB of super-fast SSD data and even comes with a VPN server and a 4K HDMI port
A workstation PC with 540TB storage is within reach — this tower case can hold up to 15 x 36TB Seagate HDDs
Design and internal specifications
Slightly larger than two stacked shoeboxes, the XCY X108 remains modest in size while offering several storage options. Buyers can choose between versions with four, six, or eight bays, depending on capacity requirements. The system runs on
Intel
’s N150, a 10nm processor with four cores and four threads clocked up to 3.6GHz. Although not that powerful compared with
workstation
hardware, its lower energy draw may prove useful for a device intended for continuous operation. Are you a pro?</div>

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget. General Motors is going to be
scaling back production
of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, as well as the Chevy Bolt EV as it expects sales of electric vehicles to slow dramatically. The $7,500
consumer tax credit
for purchasing a new EV is set to expire at the end of the month. That credit has been crucial to driving demand for EVs, which are still more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts. The company is pausing production on the Lyriq and Vistiq at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant in December. It’s also planning to halt manufacturing for a week in November and October, as well as slow production during the first five months of 2026 by temporarily laying off one of its shifts of workers.</div>

Microsoft&#x27;s cloud service restored after reports of cut cables in the Red Sea
An incident involving &quot;undersea fiber cuts&quot; that affected the Middle East was resolved by Saturday evening. Jackson Chen

Microsoft said its
Azure cloud platform
has returned to normal service after an incident of cut underwater cables that played out over Saturday. The tech giant reported &quot;
undersea fiber cuts
&quot; in the Red Sea on Saturday morning, which disrupted Azure service throughout the Middle East and led to potential &quot;increased latency&quot; for users. Microsoft said that the latency issue was resolved by Saturday evening and was able to reroute the Azure traffic through other paths. Microsoft didn&#x27;t provide a reason for why the undersea cables were cut. These cables sit on the ocean floor and play the crucial role of delivering massive amounts of data across the world. While ships dropping anchors can sometimes damage undersea cables, there have been more intentional circumstances in the past. In 2024, the internationally recognized government of Yemen claimed that the country&#x27;s Houthi movement was responsible for
cutting cables
in the Red Sea. While Microsoft managed to restore service for its latest episode the same day, it also noted that undersea cable cuts &quot;can take time to repair&quot; and that it &quot;will continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimize routing to reduce customer impact in the meantime.&quot;

                <div class="summary">The European Commission
announced
this week that it’s fining Google €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion). The commission found that Google had violated European Union antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services. Specifically, the commission said Google “abused” its “dominant positions” by favoring its ad exchange AdX in both its publisher ad server and in its ad-buying tools. The commission also said Google has 60 days to “bring these self-preferencing practices to an end” and “to implement measures to cease its inherent conflicts of interest along the adtech supply chain.”
“Google must now come forward with a serious remedy to address its conflicts of interest, and if it fails to do so, we will not hesitate to impose strong remedies,” said Teresa Ribera, the commission’s executive vice president for clean, just and competitive transition, in a statement. “Digital markets exist to serve people and must be grounded in trust and fairness. And when markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power.”
In response,
a Google spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal
that the company would appeal the commission’s decision, adding, “There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”
The WSJ reports
that the announcement was delayed from a planned date of September 1, reportedly due to concerns over the European Union and United States’ continuing negotiations over a potential trade deal. This is the EU’s second largest antitrust fine ever (behind
a $5 billion fine
against Google in 2018). The decision was criticized not just by Google, but also by U.S. President Donald Trump, who
complained in a Truth Social post
about the “many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies” such as Apple.</div>

It was in 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, when NASA decided to put a satellite into orbit to track emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere through human activity. After many twists and turns, NASA&#x27;s 23-year remit of charting greenhouse gas emissions could come to a close as soon as the end of this month. President Donald Trump&#x27;s
budget request to Congress
calls for terminating 41 of NASA&#x27;s 124 science missions in development or operations, and another 17 would see their funding zeroed out in the near future. Overall, the proposed budget slashes NASA&#x27;s spending by 25 percent and cuts NASA&#x27;s science funding in half. This year&#x27;s federal budget runs out September 30, and although lawmakers from both parties have
signaled they will reject most of Trump&#x27;s cuts
, it&#x27;s far from certain that Congress will pass a budget for the next fiscal year before the looming deadline. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has directed NASA managers to make plans to close out the missions tagged for cancellation. Without specific congressional direction, the White House would have a clear hand at implementing Trump&#x27;s wishes.</div>

Ulefone Armor Pad 5 Ultra carries one of the largest batteries in tablets around today
There&#x27;s also a projector integrated directly into this device
Forget about portability, this device is 27.8 mm thick and weighs 1.6 kg
Ulefone is preparing to unveil the Armor Pad 5 Ultra, a device which appears determined to test the boundaries of what a
rugged tablet
can be. The device features dual versatile LED lights, dual warning lights, a projector, and a battery capacity more often associated with
portable power stations
. The result is a product that seems more like an experiment in extremes than a conventional business tablet. You may like

Heavy build and durability standards
At 27.8 mm thick and weighing 1.6 kg, the Ulefone Armor Pad 5 Ultra is no lightweight companion, and in fact is heavier than many
business PCs
on the market. The device uses an 11-inch FHD+ LCD screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and brightness up to 600 nits. More unusual is the built-in projector, which operates at 200 lumens with a 960 x 540 resolution - but while intriguing on paper, these numbers indicate modest performance compared to standalone projectors. It also comes with a handle that doubles as a stand, suggesting attempts to improve projection alignment. Are you a pro?</div>

became a viral sensation when he posted videos of himself controlling a modular synth with mushrooms on

gives anyone similar capabilities, but without having to spend thousands of dollars on a Eurorack rig – and in a much more portable package. A core part of Modern Biology’s setup is a module called

The Square Enix team behind
Final Fantasy Tactics — The Ivalice Chronicles
didn&#x27;t just remaster the iconic strategy RPG, they had to go through the trouble of remaking the source code from scratch, according to
Bloomberg
. In an interview with
Bloomberg
&#x27;s Jason Schreier, the game&#x27;s director Kazutoyo Maehiro explained the arduous process of designing
The Ivalice Chronicles,
which is set to release at the end of the month. When getting to work on the remake, Maehiro and his team discovered they had to rebuild the source code from the ground up since it was lost thanks to the industry&#x27;s unstandardized practices in the &#x27;90s, according to
Bloomberg
. When translating
Final Fantasy Tactics
from Japanese to English for the global release, the company would overwrite the original Japanese version&#x27;s code. For Maehiro, that meant the team had to undertake a ground-up overhaul and recreate the source code by playing the original game that released in 1997, consulting the game&#x27;s master disc and looking at the 2011 version called
Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions
, according to
Bloomberg
. Maehiro also said during a
PAX West 2025 panel
that the team gleaned a lot of lost info from fan-made databases. Revealing more of the behind-the-scenes decisions for
The Ivalice Chronicles
, Maehiro told
Bloomberg
about the debate surrounding Count Cidolfus Orlandeau. Better known as Cid, and appropriately nicknamed Thunder God Cid, this overtuned character joins you later in the game, but many fans complained about him being overpowered.</div>
