Thinking Machines Lab co-founder Andrew Tulloch heads to Meta
Thinking Machines Lab
, the AI startup led by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost one of its co-founders to Meta.
The Wall Street Journal reports
that AI researcher Andrew Tulloch announced his departure to employees in a message on Friday. A Thinking Machine Labs spokesperson confirmed Tulloch’s departure to the WSJ, saying he “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.”
Back in August, the WSJ reported that
Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive AI recruiting blitz
included an offer to acquire Thinking Machines Lab — and when that failed, Zuckerberg reportedly tried to lure Tulloch with a compensation package that could have been worth up to $1.5 billion over at least six years. (At the time, a Meta spokesperson said that the WSJ’s description of the offer was “inaccurate and ridiculous.”)
Tulloch previously worked at OpenAI and Facebook’s AI Research Group.

                <div class="summary">When dirt meets data: ScottsMiracle-Gro saved $150M using AI
James Thomason
October 11, 2025
How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage
For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”
Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.
The AI revolution finds an unexpected leader
Enterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.
Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.
A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil science
Baxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.
“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023.</div>

Why doesn’t
Cards Against Humanity
print its game in the US? It’s complicated.
Price, quality, speed, and relationships all matter.

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) this week
announced its newest stunt
: a &quot;Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke&quot; edition that ditches the game&#x27;s rules and adds explanatory notes to each card in the box. This makes the project &quot;informational material&quot; rather than a &quot;game,&quot; and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship.
While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week&#x27;s news did raise a question I&#x27;ve heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn&#x27;t it print the game in the US? I mean, it&#x27;s just a box of cards! How hard can it be?
In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it&#x27;s often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).
Earlier this year, for instance, I
quoted two board game designers
who had looked into US production and found it infeasible.</div>

Topfeel G1 and G1 Pro power both the GPU and the mini PC through one shared supply
Aluminum frames and dual-fan support make the Pro model stand out
OCulink connection ensures strong GPU bandwidth without proprietary limitations or bottlenecks
Topfeel, a Chinese manufacturer best known for its oddly memorable name, has entered the external graphics market with two new OCulink eGPU docks, the G1 and G1 Pro.
Designed to boost the performance of
mini PCs
, these docks bring desktop-level graphics power to compact systems.
Rather than acting as simple expansion boxes, they can physically host both a
GPU
and a mini PC in one setup, turning them into a unified, small-scale computing unit.

This mini PC has two 10Gb Ethernet LAN ports, a fingerprint reader, and can even connect to an external GPU - so remind me again why we need a full desktop PC?
This ultra slim mini PC is essentially a Core i9 laptop with an RTX 5070 laptop GPU, but sans a battery, keyboard, and screen
This is the weirdest &#x27;eGPU&#x27; setup I&#x27;ve seen so far in 2025: this one has a strange mini PC holder and up to 150W Thunderbolt 5 power delivery
Turning compact PCs into performance stations
The built-in power system can supply both the mini PC and the graphics card at the same time, allowing the combined setup to run as a self-contained computing unit.
The G1 and G1 Pro both rely on the OCulink (PCIe 4.0 x4) interface, ensuring full compatibility with standard desktop GPUs rather than locking users into proprietary connections.</div>

Apple’s Clips video editing app is no more. It
debuted in 2017
as a way to stitch together videos with music, text, and filters with a clear focus on
sharing to social media
. Over the years Apple added
AR features
and more advanced
video editing tools
. But recently updates had slowed to a trickle.
Apple finally decided to pull the plug though, removing Clips from the App Store. The company also updated its
support page
to state clearly that “the Clips app is no longer being updated, and will no longer be available for download for new users as of October 10, 2025.” If you’ve already downloaded the app you can continue to use it on iOS and iPadOS. But it might also be a good idea to save any videos directly to your Photos library.</div>

OpenAI no longer has to preserve all of its ChatGPT data, with some exceptions
The latest decision in New York Times&#x27; copyright infringement case against OpenAI puts an end to a sweeping order related to chatlogs.

The controversial
preservation order
requiring OpenAI to indefinitely keep records of its ChatGPT data has been terminated. Federal judge Ona T. Wang filed a new order on October 9 that frees OpenAI of an obligation to &quot;preserve and segregate all output log data that would otherwise be deleted on a going forward basis.&quot;
The case kicked off in late 2023, with the
New York Times
suing OpenAI
for copyright infringement, alleging that the AI giant trained its models with the news outlet&#x27;s intellectual property without proper compensation. In May of this year, OpenAI was ordered to retain all of its chat logs so that the
NYT
could investigate claims of copyright violation. In response, OpenAI appealed the court order, arguing that the preservation order was an &quot;overreach&quot; and risks its users&#x27; privacy.
However, this latest decision means the AI giant no longer has to preserve chat logs as of September 26, except for some. The judge in the case said that any chat logs already saved under the previous order would still be accessible and that OpenAI is required to hold on to any data related to ChatGPT accounts that have been flagged by the
NYT
. Moving forward, the
NYT
is allowed to expand the number of flagged users, as it continues to comb through OpenAI&#x27;s preserved records.

                <div class="summary">Weaponized AI can dismantle patches in 72 hours — but Ivanti&#x27;s kernel defense can help
Louis Columbus
October 10, 2025
Adversaries from cybercrime gangs to nation-state cyberattack squads are fine-tuning weaponized AI with the goal of defeating new patches in 3 days or less. The quicker the attack, the more time to explore a victim’s network, exfiltrate data, install ransomware or set up reconnaissance that will last for months or years. Traditional, manual patching is now a liability, rendering enter organizations defenseless against weaponized AI attacks
&quot;Threat actors are reverse engineering patches, and the speed at which they&#x27;re doing it has been enhanced greatly by AI,&quot; Mike Riemer, SVP of Network Security Group and Field CISO at
Ivanti
told VentureBeat in a recent interview. &quot;They&#x27;re able to reverse engineer a patch within 72 hours. So if I release a patch and a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of that release, they&#x27;re open to exploit.&quot;
This isn&#x27;t theoretical speculation. It&#x27;s the hard reality forcing vendors to rearchitect their security infrastructure from the kernel up completely. Last week, Ivanti released Connect Secure (ICS) version 25.X, marking what Riemer calls &quot;tangible evidence&quot; of the company&#x27;s commitment to meeting this threat head-on. At
DEF CON 33
researchers from
AmberWolf
proved this threat real, demonstrating complete authentication bypasses in
Zscaler
,
Netskope
, and Check Point by exploiting vulnerabilities that existed for months, including Zscaler&#x27;s failure to validate SAML assertions (
CVE-2025-54982
), Netskope’s credential-free OrgKey access, and Check Point’s hard-coded SFTP keys exposing tenant logs were all flaws left open and exploitable more than 16 months after initial disclosure. Why Kernel Security matters
The kernel is the central orchestrator of everything that happens in a computing device, controlling memory, processes, and hardware.</div>

Marvel Studios has dropped the first teaser for
Wonder Man
, an eight-episode miniseries slated for a January release, ahead of its panel at New York Comic Con this weekend. Part of the MCU&#x27;s Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (
Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings
) and Andrew Guest (
Hawkeye
), with Guest serving as showrunner. It has been in development since 2022. The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo (
Falcon
and the
Winter Soldier)
then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (&quot;ionic energy&quot;) via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a
Wonder Man
miniseries makes sense. In the new miniseries, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II stars as Simon Williams, aka Wonder Man, an actor and stunt person with actual superpowers who decides to audition for the lead role in a superhero TV series—a reboot of an earlier Wonder Man incarnation. Demetrius Grosse plays Simon&#x27;s brother, Eric, aka Grim Reaper; Ed Harris plays Simon&#x27;s agent, Neal Saroyan; and Arian Moayed plays P. Clearly, an agent with the Department of Damage Control.</div>

Bezos imagines orbital data centers fueled by constant sunlight beyond Earth’s atmosphere
The plan promises endless energy, no clouds, and no weather interference
Launching and maintaining space-based servers could cost billions in failed missions
Jeff Bezos has outlined a future where
data center
operations may no longer be bound to Earth. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, the
Amazon
founder described a potential shift toward orbital computing infrastructure. He suggested that within two decades, gigawatt-scale facilities could operate in space using uninterrupted solar power. You may like

AI’s infrastructure problem is bigger than we think—here’s how to solve it
Remember the doomed AI nation ship? A shipping giant is now planning a real, moving, floating data center that could power thousands of AI GPUs
A new frontier for computing power
The idea rests on the argument that space offers advantages no terrestrial site can match. This includes permanent sunlight, the absence of weather disruptions, and theoretically unlimited power generation. Bezos stated that “giant training clusters” for
AI tools
would be better hosted beyond Earth’s atmosphere, where cooling and energy supply are less constrained. In a public conversation with Ferrari and Stellantis chairman John Elkann, Bezos said, &quot;These giant training clusters will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7.</div>
