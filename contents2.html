The 21 foundational researchers behind that breakthrough are now the most highly sought-after talent in Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg recruited five of the o1 researchers to work on Meta&#x27;s new superintelligence-focused unit, offering compensation packages north of $100 million. OpenAI&#x27;s agents are the product of a years-long, deliberate effort within the company to create general-purpose agents that can complete complex tasks like humans would. The company combined large language models, reinforcement learning, and test-time computation to achieve breakthroughs in AI reasoning capabilities.</div>

The model can analyze charts, diagrams, PDFs, and photos, outperforming OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4.1 and Meta&#x27;s Llama 4 in benchmark tests while requiring only two GPUs. Command A Vision is built on Cohere&#x27;s Command A architecture using Llava architecture, turning visual features into soft vision tokens divided into tiles. The model was trained in three stages: vision-language alignment, supervised fine-tuning, and post-training reinforcement learning with human feedback. Cohere offers Command A Vision as an open weights system for enterprises looking to move away from closed or proprietary models.</div>

                <div class="source-content">OpenAI removed a ChatGPT feature after it was discovered that thousands of private ChatGPT conversations were appearing in Google search results due to a misleading &#x27;Make this chat discoverable&#x27; option that users accidentally enabled when sharing chats. Fast Company exposed the privacy issue, reporting that while the indexing did not include identifying information about users, some chats shared personal details that could potentially identify them. OpenAI&#x27;s chief information security officer Dane Stuckey explained that all users whose chats were exposed opted in to indexing by clicking a box after choosing to share a chat, but the feature was designed misleadingly. OpenAI initially defended the labeling as &#x27;sufficiently clear&#x27; but ultimately decided the feature &#x27;introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn&#x27;t intend to.&#x27;</div>

The price increase follows Trump&#x27;s new tariffs, including a 20% levy on products from Vietnam where Nintendo manufactures most Switch consoles. Nintendo said on Friday that its decision to raise the price was &#x27;based on market conditions,&#x27; implementing similar pricing in Canada on August 1st. The announcement came one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing new &#x27;reciprocal&#x27; tariffs on various countries. Nintendo also issued $10 price increases for the Alarmo and Switch 1 Joy-Cons. With the price increase, the Switch OLED is now only slightly less expensive than the $449.99 Switch 2.</div>

According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, this represents a major change from Apple&#x27;s earlier stance when the company partnered with OpenAI in 2024 to infuse Siri with ChatGPT instead of developing its own AI chatbot. The new capabilities could be a standalone app or support AI features for Siri, Spotlight, and Safari, led by former Siri overseer Robby Walker. The team has been advertising job openings that mention wanting experience with search algorithms and engine development. Apple has experienced growing pains with AI, delaying the release of the new-and-improved Siri, and CEO Tim Cook said Apple is open to acquisitions to fast-track its AI roadmap.</div>
