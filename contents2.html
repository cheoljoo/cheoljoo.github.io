                <div class="summary">geCKo Materials, the 2024 TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield runner-up, unveiled four new products at this year&#x27;s event, expanding its commercialization efforts. Founder Dr. Capella Kerst introduced a semiconductor wafer handling tool, a robotic gripper for smooth surfaces, a curved robotic &quot;end effector&quot; for irregular shapes, and an all-purpose robotic arm gripper. Inspired by lizard feet, geCKo&#x27;s dry adhesive is described as a residue-free, quick-attach/detach, and non-electrical alternative to Velcro. A one-inch tile can hold 16 pounds and endure up to 120,000 attachments, functioning for varying durations. The technology&#x27;s adaptability has attracted major clients like Ford, NASA, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Since last year&#x27;s competition, geCKo has tripled its team, secured an $8 million fundraise, and seen its adhesive used in six space missions, demonstrating its versatility across environments, including vacuums. Kerst showcased a Fanuc robotic arm utilizing geCKo tiles for object manipulation and presented videos of its commercial applications, including faster and safer semiconductor wafer movement compared to existing suction or vacuum technologies.</div>

                <div class="summary">Anysphere&#x27;s Cursor, a vibe coding platform, has launched Composer, its first proprietary coding large language model (LLM), as part of its Cursor 2.0 update. Composer is engineered for rapid and accurate coding tasks in production environments, marking an advancement in AI-assisted programming. It is already integrated into Cursor&#x27;s internal development, signifying its maturity. Cursor claims Composer completes most interactions in under 30 seconds, demonstrating strong reasoning across extensive codebases. The model is reportedly four times faster than comparable intelligent systems and is optimized for &quot;agentic&quot; workflows, where autonomous coding agents collaborate on planning, writing, testing, and reviewing code. Previously, Cursor utilized leading proprietary LLMs from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI for &quot;vibe coding,&quot; which allowed users to generate or complete code using natural language instructions; these external LLM options remain available. Composer&#x27;s performance is evaluated using &quot;Cursor Bench,&quot; an internal benchmark that assesses correctness, adherence to abstractions, style conventions, and engineering practices. On this benchmark, Composer achieves cutting-edge coding intelligence, generating at 250 tokens per second.</div>

                <div class="summary">Steven Hatfill, a senior advisor for the Department of Health and Human Services, was fired over the weekend for allegedly using a fake, inflated title and failing to cooperate with leadership. Hatfill, however, claimed his ouster was part of a &quot;coup to overthrow M. Kennedy,&quot; referring to anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and accused Kennedy&#x27;s chief of staff, Matt Buckham, of orchestrating it, though he offered no evidence. An HHS spokesperson refuted this, stating that a firing for cause does not constitute a coup. Bloomberg initially reported Hatfill&#x27;s termination. Hatfill&#x27;s role and subsequent dismissal are significant due to his history, particularly his influence in Kennedy&#x27;s decision to cancel $500 million in federal grants for mRNA vaccine development. This cancellation drew strong criticism from medical and scientific communities, who warned it would leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and allow other nations to take the lead in scientific advancements. Hatfill is known for his strong opposition to mRNA vaccine technology.</div>

This acquisition follows Bending Spoons securing a $2.8 billion debt financing package. AOL has a history of changing ownership, having merged with Time Warner in 2001, been spun off, sold to Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion, and then merged with Yahoo under the Oath umbrella before being offloaded to Apollo Global Management in 2021 for approximately $5 billion. Despite its numerous transitions, AOL continues to offer a web portal and email service, though it recently ceased its dial-up internet service after more than three decades. Bending Spoons aims to retain AOL and not become another company to sell it.</div>

                <div class="summary">General Motors (GM) is cutting over 1,700 manufacturing jobs in its electric vehicle (EV) and battery sectors, primarily at plants in Michigan and Ohio, with an additional 700 temporary layoffs at an Ultium Cells plant in Tennessee. This decision is a response to slower near-term EV adoption and a changing regulatory landscape, as GM aims to realign its EV production capacity. The company, however, reaffirms its commitment to its U.S. manufacturing presence, believing that investments in flexible operations will enhance its resilience. The regulatory challenges likely include the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax rebate for EV purchases earlier this year. This move also follows GM&#x27;s recent announcement to scale back hydrogen fuel cell R&amp;D to concentrate more on batteries, charging technology, and EVs, making the layoffs in these areas particularly impactful.</div>
