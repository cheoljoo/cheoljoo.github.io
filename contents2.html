                <div class="summary">There’s a new AI-powered toy for kids called
Stickerbox
, and, before you groan, I’m here to report that it’s surprisingly fun.
Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup
Hapiko
, is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere.
Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similiar: “
An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own
.”
After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.
Stickerbox
, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.

Testing the AI sticker printer
The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.
The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that the Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.
Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.
To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network.</div>

Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 is here: Cheaper AI, infinite chats, and coding skills that beat humans

Anthropic
released its most capable artificial intelligence model yet on Monday, slashing prices by roughly two-thirds while claiming state-of-the-art performance on software engineering tasks — a strategic move that intensifies the AI startup&#x27;s competition with deep-pocketed rivals OpenAI and Google.
The new model,
Claude Opus 4.5
, scored higher on Anthropic&#x27;s most challenging internal engineering assessment than any human job candidate in the company&#x27;s history, according to materials reviewed by VentureBeat. The result underscores both the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI systems and growing questions about how the technology will reshape white-collar professions.
The Amazon-backed company is pricing Claude Opus 4.5 at
$5 per million input tokens
and
$25 per million output tokens
— a dramatic reduction from the $15 and $75 rates for its predecessor,
Claude Opus 4.1
, released earlier this year. The move makes frontier AI capabilities accessible to a broader swath of developers and enterprises while putting pressure on competitors to match both performance and pricing.
&quot;We want to make sure this really works for people who want to work with these models,&quot; said Alex Albert, Anthropic&#x27;s head of developer relations, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;That is really our focus: How can we enable Claude to be better at helping you do the things that you don&#x27;t necessarily want to do in your job?&quot;
The announcement comes as Anthropic races to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field. OpenAI recently released
GPT-5.1
and a specialized coding model called
Codex Max
that can work autonomously for extended periods.</div>

The US space agency ended months of speculation about the next flight of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, confirming Monday that the vehicle will carry only cargo to the International Space Station.
NASA and Boeing are now targeting no earlier than April 2026 to fly the uncrewed Starliner-1 mission, the space agency said. Launching by next April will require completion of rigorous test, certification, and mission readiness activities, NASA added
in a statement
.
“NASA and Boeing are continuing to rigorously test the Starliner propulsion system in preparation for two potential flights next year,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in a statement.
Reducing crewed missions
NASA also said it has reached an agreement with Boeing to modify the Commercial Crew contract, signed in 2014, that called for six crewed flights to the space station following certification of the spacecraft. Now the plan is to fly Starliner-1 carrying cargo, and then up to three additional missions before the space station is retired.
“This modification allows NASA and Boeing to focus on safely certifying the system in 2026, execute Starliner’s first crew rotation when ready, and align our ongoing flight planning for future Starliner missions based on station’s operational needs through 2030,” Stich said.</div>

Black Friday
is nearly here and HP’s deals are now live, making this a great moment to pick up a new laptop for home,
work
or
study
, without blowing the budget.
If you want a big display at a small price, the 17.3 inch FHD models are strong picks.
One runs an AMD Ryzen 5
with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, while
another version
steps up to a 13th Gen Intel Core i5, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD.
Creatives (and gamers) should look at the
Victus 15
. It has a fast 144Hz screen, an AMD Ryzen 7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 4050 GPU. It offers more than enough power for heavier creative workloads.
If you want the latest AI focused hardware, take a look at HP’s Copilot+ PCs. The
OmniBook 5
is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip, has an OLED display and long battery life. The larger
OmniBook X
moves to an Intel Core Ultra processor, Intel Arc graphics, a 17.3 inch touchscreen.
There are also solid mid range choices. The
HP 15.6 inch touch model
with an Intel Core i5 and 16GB of RAM is a dependable option for work or school. The
16 inch OmniBook 5
has an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a bright WUXGA screen.
Finally, if it&#x27;s versatility you&#x27;re after, the
OmniBook Ultra Flip
has a sharp 3K OLED touchscreen and a flexible design that works just as well for writing as it does for streaming.
Whatever you’re looking for, HP’s Black Friday lineup has plenty of value across sizes, processors, and features.

Signal is
launching secure backups on iOS
, allowing you to save and restore your messages in case you lose or break your phone. With the free version of the feature, you can store up to 100MB of text messages, along with the past 45 days’ worth of photos, videos, GIFs, and files.
There’s also a $1.99 per month option that can back up all of your text messages, in addition to up to 100GB of media beyond the 45-day cap. Signal
first launched secure backups
on Android devices in September, which store your messages and media using end-to-end encryption. You can access your backup using a 64-character recovery key generated on your device, though Signal notes that it can’t help you recover the code if you lose it.</div>

In the last few years, pizza ovens have become as much of a backyard staple as a grill. There are many options for making restaurant-quality pies at home in a range of styles. What’s more, many models allow you to change up the fuel type, and some even allow you to do more than simply fire off pizzas. I’ve compiled a list of the best pizza ovens that you can buy right now, with selections for multi-fuel ovens, compact designs and indoor pizza parties. I’ve also included some buying advice on what to consider before you commit and how to get the most out of your at-home pizza making experience.

AI is too risky to insure, say people whose job is insuring risk
What happens when the software that everyone’s racing to adopt becomes too risky for anyone to insure? According to
reporting from the Financial Times
, we’re about to find out.
Major insurers including AIG, Great American, and WR Berkley are asking U.S. regulators for permission to exclude AI-related liabilities from corporate policies. One underwriter describes the AI models’ outputs to the FT as “too much of a black box.”
The industry has good reason to be spooked, the story reminds us. Google’s AI Overview falsely accused a solar company of legal troubles, triggering a
$110 million
lawsuit back in March. Air Canada last year got stuck honoring a discount its
chatbot invented
. And fraudsters last year used a digitally cloned version of a senior executive to steal
$25 million
from the London-based design engineering firm Arup during a video call that seemed entirely real.
What really terrifies insurers isn’t one massive payout; it’s the systemic risk of thousands of simultaneous claims when a widely used AI model steps in it. As one Aon executive put it, insurers can handle a $400 million loss to one company. What they can’t handle is an agentic AI mishap that triggers 10,000 losses at once.

Lean4: How the theorem prover works and why it&#x27;s the new competitive edge in AI
Dhyey Mavani
November 23, 2025
Large language models (LLMs) have astounded the world with their capabilities, yet they remain plagued by unpredictability and hallucinations – confidently outputting incorrect information. In high-stakes domains like finance, medicine or autonomous systems, such unreliability is unacceptable.
Enter
Lean4
, an open-source programming language and interactive theorem prover becoming a key tool to inject rigor and certainty into AI systems. By leveraging formal verification, Lean4 promises to make AI safer, more secure and deterministic in its functionality. Let&#x27;s explore how Lean4 is being adopted by AI leaders and why it could become foundational for building trustworthy AI.
What is Lean4 and why it matters
Lean4 is both a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formal verification. Every theorem or program written in Lean4 must pass a strict type-checking by Lean’s trusted kernel, yielding a binary verdict: A statement either checks out as correct or it doesn’t. This all-or-nothing verification means there’s no room for ambiguity – a property or result is proven true or it fails. Such rigorous checking “
dramatically increases the reliability
” of anything formalized in Lean4. In other words, Lean4
provides a framework
where correctness is mathematically guaranteed, not just hoped for.
This level of certainty is precisely what today’s AI systems lack. Modern AI outputs are generated by complex neural networks with probabilistic behavior. Ask the same question twice and you might get different answers. By contrast, a Lean4 proof or program will behave deterministically – given the same input, it produces the same verified result every time. This determinism and transparency (every inference step can be audited) make Lean4 an appealing antidote to AI’s unpredictability.</div>

Automotive lighting tech. It’s not something most people think about, but just like touchscreens, infotainment systems, cameras, and
ADAS
(Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), lighting tech has evolved by leaps and bounds over the last few years, and has become an integral part of the modern vehicle experience – especially in EVs, where power efficiency is critical to getting the most range out of the battery pack.
From exterior dot-matrix displays and pixel grilles, to matrix headlights, to
OLED
taillights, to customizable ambient lighting, the latest lighting tech is increasing safety while also enabling new ways for drivers to personalize their vehicles. Because, let’s face it, some of this new lighting tech is bedazzling EVs and combustion vehicles alike. So, what’s new in this domain? Why should you care? Let’s dive in and find out.

In case you haven’t noticed, retro-chic is fashionable these days, and pixelated design motifs are in right now. Just check out the headlights and taillights on Hyundai’s EVs – like the
IONIQ 5
and
IONIQ 9
I drove this year – or the Glyph Matrix on the back of
Nothing’s Phone 3
. Then there’s the grille on Mercedes’
new GLC EV,
which features an optional array of 942 white “pixels” and basically doubles as a pixelated dot-matrix display.</div>

Nintendo has made some of the most iconic video games of all time, but building a library of the standouts can quickly become expensive, especially given that many titles don’t often go on sale at a significant discount. The good news is that Nintendo is already running a holiday sale in the run-up to Black Friday, allowing you to save on Nintendo Switch games, amiibo, and accessories through November 28th.</div>
