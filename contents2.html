                <div class="summary">Monday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It’s time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote
in a late-night post
on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”
On its own, it’s a pretty standard tech departure announcement — but it’s part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Five members of
the company’s 12-person founding team
have now left the company, with four of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babushkin
left to found a venture firm
, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month,
citing health issues
.
By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.
There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with
bizarre behavior
and
apparent internal tampering
— the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that
flooded the platform with deepfake pornography
, sparking slow-moving but real
legal consequences
.
Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already
spinning up plans for orbital data centers
, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model dev...</div>

Is agentic AI ready to reshape Global Business Services?
N. Shashidar, EdgeVerve
February 10, 2026
Presented by EdgeVerve
Before addressing Global Business Services (GBS), let’s take a step back. Can agentic AI, the type of AI able to take goal-driven action, transform not just GBS but any kind of enterprise? And has it done so yet?
As with many new technologies, rhetoric has outpaced deployment in this case. While 2025 was “supposed to be the year of agentic AI,” it didn’t turn out that way, according to VentureBeat Contributing Editor Taryn Plumb. Leaning on input from Google Cloud and integrated development environment (IDE) company Replit, Plumb reported in a
December 2025 VentureBeat post
that what has been missing are the fundamentals required to scale.
Given the experience of Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative (gen)AI, this outcome is not surprising. In a survey conducted at the February 2025
Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Network (SSON) summit
, 65% of GBS organizations responded that they had yet to complete a GenAI project. One can safely say that the adoption of the more recently arrived agentic AI is still in its very nascent stages for enterprises, including GBS.
The role of agentic AI in Global Business Services
There are good reasons, nonetheless, to focus on the tremendous potential of agentic AI and its application to the GBS sector.
Stripped of hype, Agentic AI unlocks capabilities in the orchestration layer of software workflows that weren’t practical before. It does so through a range of techniques, including (but not requiring) LLMs. While enterprises may indeed be missing certain fundamentals needed to deploy agentic AI at scale, those prerequisites are not out of reach.
As for GBS and Global Capability Centers (GCCs), they have already been undergoing a makeover, from back-office extensions into increasingly strategic enterprise partners. Agentic AI is a natural fit because one of its standard use cases involves IT oper...</div>

Wikipedia editors are discussing whether to blacklist Archive.today because the archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blogger who wrote a post in 2023 about the mysterious website’s anonymous maintainer.
In a
request for comment page
, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.
Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.
“Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community
decided to blacklist it
in 2013. In 2016, the decision
was overturned
, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.”
Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely
not
more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintai...</div>

Microsoft launches scanner to detect poisoned language models before deployment
Backdoored LLMs can hide malicious behavior until specific trigger phrases appear
The scanner identifies abnormal attention patterns tied to hidden backdoor triggers
Microsoft
has announced the development of a new scanner designed to detect hidden backdoors in open-weight large language models used across enterprise environments.
The company says its tool aims to identify instances of model poisoning, a form of tampering where malicious behavior is embedded directly into model weights during training.
These backdoors can remain dormant, allowing affected
LLMs
to behave normally until narrowly defined trigger conditions activate unintended responses.

The EasySMX S10 is a fantastic wireless controller for the Switch 2 that offers nearly as many features as Nintendo’s $90 gamepad. I ranked it as the
best Switch 2 controller
you can buy, thanks to its satisfying rumble sensation in games, support for motion controls as well as Nintendo’s amiibo NFC figures, plus the ability to remotely wake your console. Not to mention, it has durable TMR joysticks that are designed to last a lot longer than the hardware used by Nintendo in its controller.
I think it’s worth considering even at its original $59.99, but it’s considerably cheaper for the rest of the day at

Meta has been going all in on AI, whether people want it or not, and now it&#x27;s bringing more
features
in that vein to Facebook. The network&#x27;s latest move is to let people use Meta AI to animate their profile photos. Because what better way to express your individuality than to use a pre-canned AI-generated animation on your own face?
Meta AI is also coming for your Facebook Stories and Memories. The network&#x27;s Restyle lets you use gen-AI to change up the aesthetic of your posts. You can once again use pre-canned stylings or give the AI assistant your own prompt.
In the company&#x27;s own words, the new tools that will create &quot;share-worthy moments that spark meaningful interactions and conversations with friends.&quot; I guess meaning is in the eye of the beholder. If you&#x27;re desperate to behold even more AI slop, Meta recently said its Vibes feed of exactly that content will be
getting a standalone app

                <div class="summary">OpenAI on Monday announced it’s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers. The newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was
introduced globally
in mid-January. Subscribers to OpenAI’s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said. OpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a
blog post
: “Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”
The move,
which the company announced last month
, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran yesterday from a top rival, Anthropic. In its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad. OpenAI CEO
Sam Altman got extremely testy
about his competitor’s jabs,
calling
the ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.”

What AI builders can learn from fraud models that run in 300 milliseconds
Taryn Plumb
February 9, 2026
CleoP made with Midjourney
Fraud protection is a race against scale. For instance, Mastercard’s network processes roughly 160 billion transactions a year, and experiences surges of 70,000 transactions a second during peak periods (like the December holiday rush). Finding the fraudulent purchases among those — without chasing false alarms — is an incredible task, which is why fraudsters have been able to game the system. But now, sophisticated AI models can probe down to individual transactions, pinpointing the ones that seem suspicious — in milliseconds’ time. This is the heart of Mastercard’s flagship fraud platform, Decision Intelligence Pro (DI Pro). “DI Pro is specifically looking at each transaction and the risk associated with it,” Johan Gerber, Mastercard’s EVP of security solutions, said in a recent
VB Beyond the Pilot podcast
. “The fundamental problem we&#x27;re trying to solve here is assessing in real time.”
How DI Pro works
Mastercard’s DI Pro was built for latency and speed. From the moment a consumer taps a card or clicks “buy,” that transaction flows through Mastercard’s orchestration layer, back onto the network, and then on to the issuing bank. Typically, this occurs in less than 300 milliseconds. Ultimately, the bank makes the approve-or-decline decision, but the quality of that decision depends on Mastercard’s ability to deliver a precise, contextualized risk score based on whether the transaction could be fraudulent. Complicating this whole process is the fact that they’re not looking for anomalies, per se; they’re looking for transactions that, by design, are similar to consumer behavior. At the core of DI Pro is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that Mastercard refers to as an &quot;inverse recommender&quot; architecture.</div>

At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak. Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people’s trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience. The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya’s main project, which he called a “second scientific revolution.”
In practical terms, Bhattacharya’s plan for implementing this revolution includes some good ideas that fall far short of a revolution. But his motivation for the whole thing seems to be lingering anger over the pandemic response—something his revolution wouldn’t address.</div>
