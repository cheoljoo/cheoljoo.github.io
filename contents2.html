                <div class="summary">This new AI technique creates ‘digital twin’ consumers, and it could kill the traditional survey industry
Michael Nuñez
October 13, 2025
A new
research paper
quietly published last week outlines a breakthrough method that allows large language models (LLMs) to simulate human consumer behavior with startling accuracy, a development that could reshape the multi-billion-dollar
market research industry
. The technique promises to create armies of synthetic consumers who can provide not just realistic product ratings, but also the qualitative reasoning behind them, at a scale and speed currently unattainable.
For years, companies have sought to use AI for market research, but have been stymied by a fundamental flaw: when asked to provide a numerical rating on a scale of 1 to 5, LLMs produce unrealistic and poorly distributed responses. A new paper, &quot;
LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings
,&quot; submitted to the pre-print server arXiv on October 9th proposes an elegant solution that sidesteps this problem entirely.
The international team of researchers, led by Benjamin F. Maier, developed a method they call
semantic similarity rating (SSR)
. Instead of asking an LLM for a number, SSR prompts the model for a rich, textual opinion on a product. This text is then converted into a numerical vector — an &quot;embedding&quot; — and its similarity is measured against a set of pre-defined reference statements. For example, a response of &quot;I would absolutely buy this, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for&quot; would be semantically closer to the reference statement for a &quot;5&quot; rating than to the statement for a &quot;1.&quot;
The results are striking. Tested against a massive real-world dataset from a leading personal care corporation — comprising 57 product surveys and 9,300 human responses — the SSR method achieved 90% of human test-retest reliability.</div>

Google began
experimenting with conversational image editing
earlier this year in the dev-focused AI studio, but the feature didn&#x27;t remain experimental for long. Over the summer, Google rolled out the &quot;
Nano Banana
&quot; image-editing model in Gemini 2.5 Flash. You can use this feature to modify images with just a prompt, and now you don&#x27;t even need to go to Gemini to use it. Google says Nano Banana is now coming to search, Google Photos, and NotebookLM.
The AI image editor is coming to search via Lens and AI Mode. For Lens, you can simply open the app (iOS and Android) and snap a photo to get started. When the rollout is complete, you&#x27;ll see a &quot;Create&quot; button at the bottom, with a banana icon. Tap that to enter a prompt, telling the AI how you&#x27;d like the photo changed.
When you begin an edit in Lens, the Google app will display the results and offer the chance for follow-up edits in the AI Mode interface. Google is
always looking
for more ways to get people plugged into its conversational search bot, so there&#x27;s also a separate way to access Nano Banana there. Simply select the &quot;Create image&quot; tool and enter your prompt to create an image. You can then continue the conversation to have Nano Banana change the image.
NotebookLM added a video overview feature several months back, which uses AI to generate a video summary of the content you&#x27;ve added to the notebook. The addition of Nano Banana to NotebookLM is much less open-ended.</div>

Tron: Ares
was released in cinemas on October 10 and will eventually be available to stream on Disney+.

After years of development,
Tron: Ares
is finally out of the Grid and onto the screen, bringing a new sci-fi story about the fictional cyberspace that reflects on today&#x27;s technological headlines.
While critics have slammed the new movie&#x27;s obvious plot and bland characters, the mid-credit scene strongly hints at another sequel (more on that later). But will Tron 4 go ahead following the latest film&#x27;s ropey start?
According to director Joachim Rønning, “it always depends on how many people want to see it.” Here’s what Rønning, along with
Tron: Ares
producers, told me about the likelihood of another installment, and where the Tron universe could go next.

Ads in Google search results
are getting a more prominent label
, and a way to hide them if you’re not interested. Handy! The thing is, you still have to look at them first.
Currently, Google labels paid results on search pages individually with a “sponsored” tag on each one. This change groups them all into a collapsable section at the top of the page with a single, larger label that remains in view as you scroll. At the
bottom
of the section you’ll see a button to hide sponsored results, so you’ll have to scroll by them first. Tap the button to hide them and they’ll remain collapsed under that sponsored heading; tapping again to show sponsored results unfurls them. Google says the update is rolling out now on both desktop and mobile.
Previously, each paid result got its own sponsored label.</div>

Apple TV 4K and remote
(Devindra Hardawar for Engadget)
It’s been an interesting few months in the realm of streaming service branding. Warner Bros. Discovery
reverted Max back to HBO Max
after a baffling decision to trim the name in the first place. Disney made Hulu the &quot;global general entertainment brand&quot; on Disney+ when it
rebranded the Star hub
on the service. Now Apple would like you to know that it’s changing the name of its streaming service too. Going forward, Apple TV+ is now just Apple TV.
The company revealed the news in very lowkey fashion, at the end of
a press release
about when its
F1
movie
will land on Apple TV, the streaming service with a monthly subscription (December 12, FYI). “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity,” the company said without elaborating.
Apple does like to keep things clean, and shearing off the plus sign is one way of doing that. But oversimplification can cause greater confusion.

As Apple states in its own press release, “Apple TV is available on the Apple TV app” and “For a limited time, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac can enjoy three months of Apple TV for free.” Did no one at Apple’s (generally very effective) marketing team spot the problem with this? Buying Apple TV to get free Apple TV sounds like a recursive capitalist fever dream that will never end.
As it stands, you can turn on your Apple TV device to open the Apple TV app to watch Apple TV. There are lots of things in the Apple TV app that aren’t actually Apple TV shows or movies and you may have to pay for those separately.</div>

                <div class="summary">Apart from antivirus apps, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been business to business, with regular internet users left on their own to protect themselves. And older people, who did not grow up with the internet and smartphones, are perhaps the most vulnerable.
ZoraSafe
, a startup founded by sisters Catherine Karow and Ellie King Karow wants to step in and help them out. Their idea is to create an app that not only protects older people against scammers and hackers, but also teaches them how to stay safe through gamified microlearning, as Catherine and Ellie told TechCrunch ahead of the
TechCrunch Disrupt
conference, where ZoraSafe will be part of
Startup Battlefield.
The app is not out yet, but Catherine and Ellie expect to launch it in a month. They said it will cost $12.99 a month for individual subscribers, and a higher rate for family and group plans.
The first version of the app, Catherine explained in a phone call, will have several features, such as a mode to scan QR codes for malware or phishing, the ability to send suspicious SMS text messages and emails to ZoraSafe to get them checked out, and a feature to share a known scam or threat with the app so it can be added to a database to help other users.
“We’re trying to incentivize social sharing of scams, so we can also alert the entire Zora network at once, so one person is alerted by that scam, and then we can make sure everyone in that community is protected immediately,” Catherine said.
Future releases will also include a feature that will allow users to get ZoraSafe to join a suspicious phone call, so the company’s AI system can detect if it’s a scam or a deepfake call. In that case, however, the app will not be listening to or recording the calls, according to Catherine.
Once the app detects a threat, it will spin up a chat that will explain to the user what that threat was and teach them how to spot and deal with similar situations in the future, Ellie said.</div>

We keep talking about AI agents, but do we ever know what they are?
Sean Falconer, Confluent
October 12, 2025
Imagine you do two things on a Monday morning.
First, you ask a chatbot to summarize your new emails. Next, you ask an AI tool to figure out why your top competitor grew so fast last quarter. The
AI silently gets to work
. It scours financial reports, news articles and social media sentiment. It cross-references that data with your internal sales numbers, drafts a strategy outlining three potential reasons for the competitor&#x27;s success and schedules a 30-minute meeting with your team to present its findings.
We&#x27;re calling both of these &quot;
AI agents
,&quot; but they represent worlds of difference in intelligence, capability and the level of trust we place in them. This ambiguity creates a fog that makes it difficult to build, evaluate, and safely govern these powerful new tools. If we can&#x27;t agree on what we&#x27;re building, how can we know when we&#x27;ve succeeded?
This post won&#x27;t try to sell you on yet another definitive framework. Instead, think of it as a survey of the current landscape of agent autonomy, a map to help us all navigate the terrain together.
What are we even talking about? Defining an &quot;AI agent&quot;
Before we can measure an agent&#x27;s autonomy, we need to agree on what an &quot;agent&quot; actually is. The most widely accepted starting point comes from the foundational textbook on AI, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig’s
“
Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
.”
They define an agent as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. A thermostat is a simple agent: Its sensor perceives the room temperature, and its actuator acts by turning the heat on or off.

That classic definition provides a solid mental model.</div>

Here’s how it works

Humbird 3 doubles Thunderbolt bandwidth, pushing up to 120Gbps in single-display mode
The CNC-machined aluminum body gives this eGPU dock a desktop-class structural finish
Its modular PCIe slot enables seamless GPU, SSD, or workstation switching
The Humbird 3 has entered the eGPU market with a mix of bold promises and elegant design choices.
Presented as the world’s first “desktop Thunderbolt 5 eGPU dock,” it claims to deliver
workstation
-grade speed and versatility in a body slimmer than most gaming laptops.
With its 500W GaN power system, integrated 1-inch LCD screen,
SSD
slot, and a full array of ports, the device appears ready to replace multiple desktop accessories at once.

This is the world&#x27;s smallest eGPU dock with a built-in 650W PSU - but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be comfortable with my $1,999 Geforce RTX 5090 GPU exposed to the elements
This is the weirdest &#x27;eGPU&#x27; setup I&#x27;ve seen so far in 2025: this one has a strange mini PC holder and up to 150W Thunderbolt 5 power delivery
This cheap eGPU docking station uses TB5, but you will need an external power supply to get it working
A leap in bandwidth and performance claims
At its core, the Humbird 3 uses
Intel
’s JHL9480 controller, which reportedly doubles the bandwidth from 40Gbps to 80Gbps and can reach up to 120Gbps in single-display mode.
The company describes it as the first Thunderbolt 5 dock capable of fully supporting external GPUs, and it is very thin, appearing like a pocket device.</div>

Spooky season is upon us, and traditional horror films like
Bring Her Back
(excellently gruesome) or
The Evil Dead
(stone cold classic) are obvious choices for a cozy movie night at home. But, if you’re looking for something that’s a bit more weird than wicked to get you in the
Halloween spirit
, I highly recommend the 1977 fantasy horror film
House
.
Describing
House
is an exercise in futility. Here’s the basic plot: A girl goes to spend the summer with her aunt after her widower father brings home a creepily sedate woman and declares that he intends to marry her.</div>
