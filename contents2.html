                <div class="summary">While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia.
It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI.
Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over
$1 billion that they’d crash
. (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “
batshit crazy
,” to which Burry responded by
mocking Karp
for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly?
Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.</div>

VentureBeat recently sat down (virtually) with Itamar Golan, co-founder and CEO of
Prompt Security
, to chat through the GenAI security challenges organizations of all sizes face.
We talked about shadow AI sprawl, the strategic decisions that led Golan to pursue building a market-leading platform versus competing on features, and a real-world incident that crystallized why protecting AI applications isn&#x27;t optional anymore. Golan provided an unvarnished view of the company&#x27;s mission to empower enterprises to adopt AI securely, and how that vision led to
SentinelOne&#x27;s
estimated
$250 million
acquisition in August 2025.
Golan&#x27;s path to founding Prompt Security began with academic work on transformer architectures, well before they became foundational to today&#x27;s large language models. His experience building one of the earliest GenAI-powered security features using GPT-2 and GPT-3 convinced him that LLM-driven applications were creating an entirely new attack surface. He founded Prompt Security in August 2023, raised $23 million across two rounds, built a 50-person team, and achieved a successful exit in under two years.
The timing of our conversation couldn’t be better. VentureBeat analysis shows shadow AI now costs enterprises
$4.63 million
per breach, 16% above average, yet 97% of breached organizations lack basic AI access controls, according to
IBM&#x27;s 2025 data
. VentureBeat estimates that shadow AI apps could double by mid-2026 based on current 5% monthly growth rates.
Cyberhaven
data reveals 73.8% of ChatGPT workplace accounts are unauthorized, and enterprise AI usage has grown 61x in just 24 months. As Golan told VentureBeat in previous coverage, &quot;We see 50 new AI apps a day, and we&#x27;ve already cataloged over 12,000.</div>

Peruse a
list of films
released in 1985 and you’ll notice a surprisingly high number of movies that have become classics in the ensuing 40 years. Sure, there were blockbusters like
Back to the Future, The Goonies, Pale Rider, The Breakfast Club
and
Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome
, but there were also critical arthouse favorites like
Kiss of the Spider Woman
and Akira Kurosawa’s masterpiece,
Ran
. Since we’re going into a long Thanksgiving weekend, I’ve made a list, in alphabetical order, of some of the quirkier gems from 1985 that have stood the test of time. (Some of the films first premiered at film festivals or in smaller international markets in 1984, but they were released in the US in 1985.)

After Hours

Have you ever had a dream, bordering on a nightmare, where you were trying desperately to get back home but obstacle after obstacle kept getting in your way? Martin Scorsese’s
After Hours
is the cinematic embodiment of that anxiety-inducing dreamscape. Griffin Dunne stars as a nebbishy computer data entry worker named Paul, who meets a young woman named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) and heads off to SoHo after work to meet her. The trouble begins when his $20 cab fare blows out the window en route. The date goes badly, and Paul leaves, enduring a string of increasingly strange encounters as he tries to get back to his uptown stomping grounds.</div>

Russian hackers exploit Blender’s Auto Run feature to deliver StealC infostealer via .blend files
Malware deployed through CGTrader assets, pulling payloads from Cloudflare Workers domains
StealC variant targets browsers, crypto wallets, chat apps, and VPN clients undetected
Blender has a convenient but risky feature which experts have found is being exploited by Russian hackers to deliver infostealer malware.
Cybersecurity researchers Morphisec observed the attacks in the wild and urged designers and other professionals to be vigilant.
Blender is a widely used
open source
3D creation suite popular among artists, animators, game developers, and studios for everything from modeling and rendering to visual effects. There is also CGTrader, a marketplace where 3D artists and designers can buy, sell, and share user-generated models and assets for their projects.

Significant impact
Now, Morphisec says it saw Russia-linked cybercriminals upload .blend files with embedded Python code onto CGTrader.
The code pulls a
malware
loader from a Cloudflare Workers domain which, in turn, pulls two ZIP archives. These deploy two payloads, including a StealC infostealer and an auxiliary Python stealer, likely as a fallback.
Obviously, the
Python code
needs to be triggered. That is where the “convenient, but risky” feature comes in.</div>

Dreame’s X40 Ultra is arguably the best robovac deal you can grab for Black Friday
It offers high-end features at a midrange price, which is why it remains one of our favorite robovac / mop hybrids.

Robot vacuums show up in our gift guides almost every year, and it’s easy to understand why: they clean, they save time, and they’re cheaper than hiring a professional. But not all robovacs are created equal, and some save more time than others. The
Dreame X40 Ultra
is one of those, offering a more genuinely hands-free cleaning experience than what you typically get. And now through December 1st, it’s down to a new low of $499.99 ($700 off)

ChatGPT’s voice mode is no longer a separate interface
ChatGPT’s voice mode is getting more usable. OpenAI
announced
on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode. That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text. You can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed. You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time. Rolling out to all users on mobile and web. Just update your app. pic.twitter.com/emXjNpn45w
— OpenAI (@OpenAI)
November 25, 2025
Now, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time. The change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text. This revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps.</div>

President Donald Trump’s new “
Genesis Mission
” unveiled Monday, November 24, 2025, is billed as a generational leap in how the United States does science akin to the Manhattan Project that created the atomic bomb during World War II. The executive order
directs
the Department of Energy (DOE) to build a “closed-loop AI experimentation platform” that links the country’s 17 national laboratories, federal supercomputers, and decades of government scientific data into “one cooperative system for research.”
The White House fact sheet casts the initiative as a way to “transform how scientific research is conducted” and “accelerate the speed of scientific discovery,” with priorities spanning biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion, quantum information science, and semiconductors. DOE’s own release
calls it “the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built” and quotes Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil describing it as a “closed-loop system” linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into “an engine for discovery that doubles R&amp;D productivity.”
The
text of the order outlines mandatory steps DOE must complete within 60, 90, 120, 240, and 270 days—including identifying all Federal and partner compute resources, cataloging datasets and model assets, assessing robotic laboratory infrastructure across national labs, and demonstrating an initial operating capability for at least one scientific challenge within nine months. The
DOE’s own Genesis Mission website
adds important context: the initiative is launching with a broad coalition of private-sector, nonprofit, academic, and utility collaborators.</div>

An unpiloted Chinese spacecraft launched late Monday and linked up with the country’s Tiangong space station a few hours later, providing a lifeboat for three astronauts stuck in orbit without a safe ride home. A Long March 2F rocket fired its engines and lifted off with the Shenzhou 22 spacecraft, carrying cargo instead of a crew, at 11:11 pm EST Monday (04:11 UTC Tuesday). The spacecraft docked with the Tiangong station nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the Earth about three-and-a-half hours later. Chinese engineers worked fast to move up the launch of the Shenzhou 22, originally set to fly next year. On November 5
, officials discovered one of the two crew ferry ships docked to the Tiangong station had a cracked window, likely from an impact with a small fragment of space junk. Officials made the discovery during a crew handover on the station, a few days after the arrival of a fresh three-person crew and just before the departure of three astronauts who had been in orbit since April. After engineers deemed the damaged Shenzhou 20 ship unsafe, Chinese space officials decided to send the outgoing crew back to Earth on the unblemished Shenzhou 21 spacecraft.</div>

We&#x27;re not easily surprised, but this
Black Friday

AirPods 4 for just $69 at Amazon
, down from $129 officially, and $79 yesterday. •

Black Friday deals
like this one are called doorbusters, because if this were a physical shop you&#x27;d be busting down the door to buy two pairs. It&#x27;s an exceptional offer on
Apple
&#x27;s cheapest earbuds, and who knows how long it&#x27;ll last at this price – every time we&#x27;ve seen previous models of AirPods fall this low, they sold out pretty quick. (Not in the US? See today&#x27;s best deals in your region below)

Apple AirPods 4:

This is the lowest price Amazon has ever listed the AirPods 4 for, taking them even lower than the previous record of $79. At this price there&#x27;s absolutely no hesitation: if you like this shape of AirPods, then this is the Black Friday deal you&#x27;ve been waiting for. Also:

In our
AirPods 4 review
we said they were overpriced at $129: better rivals were cheaper. But this Black Friday deal changes the game because it&#x27;s such a big price cut. And that means there&#x27;s now another big reason to go with Apple&#x27;s option rather than a rival brand. As we&#x27;ve said before, all the best features of the AirPods 4 are Apple-specific: head-tracking spatial audio, auto-device switching, Find My support, audio sharing, and so on. With these earbuds those features work perfectly and reliably.</div>
