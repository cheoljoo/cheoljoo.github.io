                <div class="summary">Top tech names were on the guest list for the banquet thrown for President Trump during his second state visit to the UK on Wednesday.
The banquet seating chart included NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang; Apple CEO Tim Cook; venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks; Alphabet and Google president Ruth Porat; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; and OpenAI’s Sam Altman,
according to the New York Times
.
On Thursday, the US and UK signed
a partnership
called the Tech Prosperity Deal to focus on developing nuclear, AI, and quantum technologies. Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenAI also made announcements earlier this week to build data centers in the UK, while CoreWeave and Salesforce
announced a multi-billion-pound
investment in the country. Overall, American tech firms committed a total of £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost AI infrastructure in the UK.
This state banquet guest list seems to have featured more tech and business names
rather than the Hollywood types
that often attend such affairs.
This change reveals the shifting economic needs of the UK and US in the age of AI, and the
rising prominence of technology
and its leaders in Trump’s second administration. Just this past year, numerous Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Apple have pledged to work with the government, from
providing AI assistant tools
to government services to
building digital health ecosystems
for the U.S. health industry.
The president has also taken a sharper focus on tech — criticizing Tim Cook
for Apple’s outsourced supply chain
, signing an “
anti-work
” AI order, as well as instructing the attorney general to investigate
private companies receiving federal funds
that have DEI programs deemed “illegal.”
Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and other tech leaders attended the president’s inauguration this year. And, in early September, President Trump threw a tech dinner with 33 top names in Silicon Valley, including Altman, Cook, and Zuckerberg.</div>

Days after someone revealed the news on social media, Samsung confirmed today that it is showing advertisements on some US customers’ smart fridges. Samsung said the ads showing on some Family Hub-series fridges are part of a pilot program, but we suspect that they may become more permanent additions to Samsung fridges and/or other types of screen-equipped smart home appliances.
In a statement sent to Ars Technica, Samsung confirmed that it is “conducting a pilot program to offer promotions and curated advertisements on certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models in the US market.”
Samsung currently lists nine Family Hub refrigerators in the US, which have MSRPs ranging
from $1,800 to $3,500
. Family Hub fridges have 21.5- or 32-inch screens, which, until now, users have had autonomy over for displaying helpful or fun things, like photos and videos, memos, weather, timers, and a web browser. Some of those abilities require a Wi-Fi connection or a Samsung account.
Now, Samsung is commandeering some of the screens already set up in homes to display ads. As Samsung’s rep explained:
As a part of this pilot program, Family Hub refrigerators in the US will receive an over-the-network (OTN) software update with Terms of Service (T&amp;C) and Privacy Notice (PN). Advertising will appear on certain Family Hub refrigerator Cover Screens. The Cover Screen appears when a Family Hub screen is idle.</div>

Verdict
Marshall Kilburn III
$379.99
at Amazon
$379.99
at Best Buy
$379.99
at Walmart
$379.99
at Newegg
The Marshall Kilburn III serves up an incredible combination of beautifully balanced audio, meaty features and premium aesthetic. Its 50-hour battery life means you’ll barely ever have to charge it too. Sure, it’s more costly than its predecessor was at launch, and you can get better protection against the elements from rivals like the Xtreme 4, but the Kilburn III is still one of the best-sounding (and looking) models in its weight class.
Pros
Exceptional battery life
Classy amp-inspired design
Highly effective placement compensation
Cons
Inferior IP rating to Xtreme 4
No multi-speaker pairing
Not as portable as JBL’s speaker
JBL Xtreme 4
$267.99
at Newegg
$299.95
at Walmart
$360.95
at Crutchfield
$369.95
at Best Buy
The JBL Xtreme 4 delivers each musical element with clarity and distinction and packs in some nifty features that build on the strengths of its predecessor. It&#x27;s a rugged, outdoorsy speaker that doesn’t go all out on style, but hits all the right notes when it comes to utility, boasting a great battery life and IP67 dustproof and waterproof rating.
Pros
Ultra-rugged design
Seriously powerful audio output
Considerably lighter than Kilburn III
Cons
Requires EQ tuning to sound its best
Lower battery life than Kilburn III
Exterior design lacks sex appeal

At its Connect keynote on Wednesday, Meta officially
introduced the $799.99 Meta Ray-Ban Display
, also known as Hypernova. The brand’s new, high-end smart glasses feature an in-lens display you can control with wrist-based gestures via the new Meta Neural Band that’s included. The display pairs with your phone and allows you to see everything from text messages and Instagram Reels to maps and more — all without having to pull out your device. They seem like a more fully-realized version of
Google Glass
, and they’ll be released on September 30th.</div>

Meta&#x27;s lineup of smart glasses could soon get a lot more capabilities. The company will begin allowing outside developers to bring their apps to its RayBan and Oakley smart glasses, Meta
announced
on the second day of its Connect event.
Up to now, Meta has only had a limited number of third-party integrations for its glasses, with apps like Spotify and Audible. But Meta will now allow developers to start experimenting with apps that can take advantage of the built-in sensors and audio capabilities of its glasses. This means other companies will be able to create their own custom experiences that use Meta&#x27;s
multimodal AI
features.
The company is already working with a set of early partners, like Twitch, which is creating livestreaming capabilities for the glasses, and Disney, which is experimenting with an app for inside its parks. A demo video shows a visitor walking around Disneyland and asking the AI assistant about the rides she&#x27;s seeing and other park information. 18Birdies, a golf app, is working on an integration that can give players club recommendations and yardage stats.

Notably, these apps all seem like they work with Meta&#x27;s non-display glasses, which means that even people who have first-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses could see a bunch of added new functionality. It&#x27;s not clear if the company will also allow developers to also build experiences that can take advantage of the display on its newest
Meta Ray-Ban Display
frames, but that could open up even more possibilities.
Meta&#x27;s new set of tools, officially called the &quot;Wearables Device Access Toolkit,&quot; will roll out as a
limited developer preview
ahead of broader availability in 2026.

                <div class="summary">Tesla is “working on” redesigning its door handles so they are less likely to trap people inside the company’s cars, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen
told Bloomberg News
on Wednesday.
The news comes just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an probe into Tesla’s door handles, and one week after a Bloomberg News investigation highlighted multiple instances where owners or passengers were stuck in their cars following a crash.
Von Holzhausen didn’t specify when Tesla made the decision to rethink how its door handles work, according to Bloomberg. China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country’s top regulator has not taken a final action.
One of the two apparent problems with Tesla’s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren’t receiving power from the car’s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.
“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. “That’s something that we’re working on.”
NHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.”
Tesla includes instructions in its owner’s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted. But NHTSA noted in its preliminary report that none of the owners who contacted the agency reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings — meaning they likely would not have known what was causing the problem.</div>

The Trump administration yesterday issued a lengthier denial of a whistleblower&#x27;s allegation that DOGE officials at the Social Security Administration (SSA) copied the agency&#x27;s database to an insecure cloud system. The allegation centers on the Numerical Identification System (NUMIDENT) database containing Americans&#x27; personally identifiable information.
The cloud location described by the whistleblower report &quot;is actually a secured server in the agency&#x27;s cloud infrastructure which historically has housed this data and is continuously monitored and overseen—SSA&#x27;s standard practice,&quot; said a
letter
sent yesterday to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
The letter was sent by SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, a Trump appointee who was previously CEO of the financial technology company Fiserv. It came in response to
Crapo&#x27;s request
for information.
&quot;I can confirm, based on the agency&#x27;s thorough review, that neither the Numident database nor any of its data has been accessed, leaked, hacked, or shared in any unauthorized fashion,&quot; Bisignano wrote.</div>

The AKG N9 (also called the AKG N9 &#x27;Hybrid&#x27; by the company) are some of the most feature-packed headphones I’ve ever tested. They have a range of ANC modes, useful on-cup touch controls and an included USB-C dongle to instantly get high-res audio from a new device. They also sound great and look fantastic, although a high price and sadly-inflexible design may put off some buyers.

AKG N9: Two minute review
As someone who tests headphones for an income, I&#x27;ve got a roster of &quot;X headphones&quot; for specific tasks. I&#x27;ve got my
best headphones
for music, my
running headphones
, a
gaming headset
, a pair of the
best earbuds
when it&#x27;s too hot for headphones, and a set-up for movies and TV shows too.
The new AKG N9 from
Samsung
&#x27;s sub-brand&#x27;s sub-brand, AKG, didn&#x27;t slot into this line-up as much as they replaced half of them, and it&#x27;s largely down to one handy feature which we also saw in their contemporary earbuds equivalent, the AKG N5.
I&#x27;m not going to do that clickbait headline thing of alluding to a feature and then dancing around the topic, only specifying it 20 paragraphs in: this feature is a dongle which comes build into the AKG N9, and if you plug it into any USB-C slot, it overrides that device&#x27;s audio output into the N9.

House committee asks Discord, Valve, Twitch and Reddit to testify on online radicalization
The committee hearing is being held in response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

REUTERS / Reuters
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY)
has asked
the CEOs of Discord, Twitch, Valve and Reddit to testify at a hearing on online radicalization. The hearing will be held on October 8, 2025, and is in direct response to
the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk
, an event some have tried to connect to the online communities the alleged shooter,
Tyler Robinson
, participated in.
&quot;Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,&quot; Comer shared in the press release announcing the hearing. &quot;To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.&quot;
Following Kirk&#x27;s death, law enforcement, regulators and the press have exerted significant effort to both understand Robinson&#x27;s actions and structure them into a coherent narrative. The fact that he seemingly engraved the bullets he used with
references to furry memes and the game
Helldivers
implies he may have been immersed in online culture, and could have been influenced by who he interacted with there. But
a recent report
on his Discord chats suggests his motivations are hard to pin down, even for his friends.
In general, online platforms don&#x27;t escape scrutiny after tragic events, so these sorts of hearings are to be expected. Twitch and Discord were both investigated by the
New York
and
New Jersey Attorney Generals
following a 2022 shooting in Buffalo, New York, for example.</div>
