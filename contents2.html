                <div class="summary">Wikipedia is often described as
the last good website
on an internet increasingly filled with toxic social media and AI slop. But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to
a new blog post
from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.
The foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”
Why is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has
disputed the claim
that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)
Miller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it
paused the effort after editors complained
.
But this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable,
reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference
on Friday.</div>

Google is adding a new feature for third-party developers building atop its Gemini AI models that rivals like OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, and the growing array of Chinese open source options are unlikely to get anytime soon:
grounding with Google Maps.
This addition allows developers to connect Google&#x27;s Gemini AI models&#x27; reasoning capabilities with live geospatial data from Google Maps, enabling applications to deliver detailed, location-relevant responses to user queries—such as business hours, reviews, or the atmosphere of a specific venue.
By tapping into data from over 250 million places, developers can now build more intelligent and responsive location-aware experiences.
This is particularly useful for applications where proximity, real-time availability, or location-specific personalization matter—such as local search, delivery services, real estate, and travel planning.
When the user’s location is known, developers can pass latitude and longitude into the request to enhance the response quality.
By tightly integrating real-time and historical Maps data into the Gemini API, Google enables applications to generate grounded, location-specific responses with factual accuracy and contextual depth that are uniquely possible through its mapping infrastructure.
Merging AI and Geospatial Intelligence
The new feature is accessible in Google AI Studio, where developers can try a live demo powered by the Gemini Live API. Models that support the grounding with Google Maps include:
Gemini 2.5 Pro
Gemini 2.5 Flash
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
Gemini 2.0 Flash
In one
demonstration
, a user asked for Italian restaurant recommendations in Chicago.
The assistant, leveraging Maps data, retrieved top-rated options and clarified a misspelled restaurant name before locating the correct venue with accurate business details.</div>

We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, from modern to ancient and all points in between. With that in mind, we’ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a
curated list of some of our favorites from GOG’s catalog
. At the end of every month, we’ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.
Twice a month, we’ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we’ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you’ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out
the earlier pieces in the series
!
Even in my youth, I always loved the idea of point-and-click adventure games more than I did the reality. I appreciated how they transported me to other worlds, each with its own rules, histories, and interesting characters. However, like many people, I often ran up against the harsh reality of solving bizarre and obtuse puzzles in a time before Internet walkthroughs.
I almost never actually finished point-and-click adventure games for that reason—but there is one major exception: I completed Roberta Williams’
The Colonel’s Bequest
several times.
One of the last Sierra adventure games to still use a text parser,
The Colonel’s Bequest
follows a young woman named Laura Bow as she visits a mansion in the Southern US belonging to her college friend’s grandfather, Colonel Henri Dijon.</div>

Picture this: I’m soaring 35,000 feet above the ground, flying through the clouds – and I’ve got the digital world at my fingertips as if I were on the ground. I’m streaming the latest Conan bit on
YouTube
on my iPad, jumping into a
Fortnite
match on my iPhone, listening to Spotify in the background, and even knocking out some work on my laptop.
Sounds impossible, right? After all, in-flight Wi-Fi is notorious for being slow, spotty, and unpredictable – varying from airline to airline, and even from plane to plane. But
United Airlines
is trying to change that. Thanks to its partnership with Starlink for its next-generation Wi-Fi product, it’s rolling out much faster Wi-Fi at no cost across its entire fleet.
The process started back in May 2025, when United began installing new antennas and Wi-Fi access points on its regional jets – dubbed
United Express.
About 170 of those planes are already equipped.

But this week marked a big milestone: United debuted Starlink on its first mainline jet, a Boeing 737-800. I got to experience it firsthand on a test flight on October 14, 2025. The flight departed from and returned to Chicago’s O’Hare Airport – and the next day, that same jet entered regular service for passengers.
To put it simply, the connection was fantastic – on par with my home internet and, at times, even faster.</div>

In the 2000s, TiVo reached heights few companies ever achieve. Like Google and Xerox, its name became a verb. People had to “TiVo” the new episode of
Battlestar Galactica
or game 4 of the Red Sox vs. Cardinals, not “record” it. While it didn’t invent the DVR, TiVo popularized it and many of the features we would eventually take for granted, like the ability to pause or rewind live TV, and watch one program while recording another.
Those features were covered in the now infamous
US Patent 6,233,389
— better known as the Time Warp patent. TiVo spent a good chunk of the 2000s and early 2010s defending its intellectual property through a series of high-profile lawsuits, most notably against
EchoStar

NVIDIA has taken a big step towards strengthening its domestic chip manufacturing, revealing the first
Blackwell wafer
made in the US. The hardware company assembled the wafer, which is the base material for NVIDIA&#x27;s AI chips, in TSMC&#x27;s semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona.
NVIDIA revealed its
Blackwell platform
last year, boasting a goal of revolutionizing the AI industry through tech giants like Amazon, Google, OpenAI and others who already committed to adopting the next-gen architecture. NVIDIA said the latest platform was more powerful and translated to 25x less cost and energy consumption compared to its predecessor. Now that Blackwell wafers can be made at the TSMC plant, NVIDIA can better insulate itself from the ever-evolving
tariff situation
and geopolitical tensions.
&quot;It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States,” Jensen Huang, NVIDIA&#x27;s founder and CEO, said at the celebration event.
With NVIDIA&#x27;s Blackwell architecture ready for the volume production stage, the company is still working on expanding its manufacturing footprint across the US. Earlier this year, NVIDIA said it had plans to funnel half a trillion dollars towards building
AI infrastructure
in the US through partnerships with TSMC, Foxconn and other companies.

fracking
a second act, a surprising twist for an industry that, even during its early 2010s boom years, was blamed by climate advocates for poisoned water tables, man-made earthquakes, and the stubborn persistence of fossil fuels.
AI companies are building massive data centers near major gas-production sites, often generating their own power by tapping directly into fossil fuels. It’s a trend that’s been overshadowed by headlines about the intersection of AI and healthcare (and solving climate change), but it’s one that could reshape — and raise difficult questions for — the communities that host these facilities.
Take the latest example. This week, the Wall Street Journal
reported
that AI coding assistant startup Poolside is constructing a data center complex on more than 500 acres in West Texas — about 300 miles west of Dallas — a footprint two-thirds the size of Central Park. The facility will generate its own power by tapping natural gas from the Permian Basin, the nation’s most productive oil and gas field, where hydraulic fracturing isn’t just common but really the only game in town.
The project, dubbed Horizon, will produce two gigawatts of computing power. That’s equivalent to the Hoover Dam’s entire electric capacity, except instead of harnessing the Colorado River, it’s burning fracked gas. Poolside is developing the facility with CoreWeave, a cloud computing company that rents out access to Nvidia AI chips and that’s supplying access to more than 40,000 of them. The Journal calls it an “energy Wild West,” which seems apt.
Yet Poolside is far from alone. Nearly all the major AI players are pursuing similar strategies. Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman toured his company’s flagship Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas — around 200 miles from the Permian Basin — where he was candid, saying, “
We’re burning gas to run this data center

Cisco executives make the case that the distinction between product and model companies is disappearing, and that accessing the 55% of enterprise data growth that current AI ignores will separate winners from losers.
VentureBeat recently caught up with Jeetu Patel,
Cisco&#x27;s
President and Chief Product Officer and DJ Sampath, Senior Vice President of AI Software and Platform, to gain new insights into a compelling thesis both leaders share. They and their teams contend that every successful product company must become an AI model company to survive the next decade.
When one considers how compressed product lifecycles are becoming, combined with the many advantages of digital twin technology to accelerate time-to-market of next-gen products, the thesis makes sense.
The conversation revealed why this transformation is inevitable, backed by solid data points. The team contends that 55% of all data growth is machine data that current AI models don&#x27;t touch. OpenAI&#x27;s Greg Brockman estimates we need 10 billion GPUs to give every human the AI agents they&#x27;ll need, and Cisco&#x27;s open source security model, Foundation-Sec-8B, has already seen 200,000 downloads on Hugging Face.
Why the model is becoming the product
VentureBeat: You&#x27;ve stated that in the future, every product company will become a model company. Why is this inevitable rather than just one possible path?
Jeetu Patel:
In the future, there&#x27;s no distinction between model companies and product companies. Great product companies will be model companies. The close tie-in between model and product is a closed loop. To enhance the product, you enhance the model, not just a UI shim.
These companies being formed right now that are a thin shim on top of a model; their days are numbered. The true moat is the model you build that drives product behavior.</div>

In 1890, a German scientist named
Robert Koch
thought he’d invented a cure for tuberculosis, a substance derived from the infecting bacterium itself that he dubbed Tuberculin. His substance didn’t actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a
diagnostic skin test
. Koch’s successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in
Dead Ends! Flukes, Flops, and Failures
that Sparked Medical Marvels
, a new nonfiction illustrated children’s book by science historian Lindsey Fitzharris and her husband, cartoonist Adrian Teal.
A noted science communicator with a fondness for the medically macabre, Fitzharris published a biography of surgical pioneer Joseph Lister,
The Butchering Art
, in 2017—a great, if occasionally grisly, read. She followed up with 2022’s
The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I
, about a WWI surgeon named Harold Gillies
who rebuilt
the faces of injured soldiers.
And in 2020, she hosted a documentary for the Smithsonian Channel,
The Curious Life and Death Of
…, exploring famous deaths, ranging from drug lord Pablo Escobar to magician Harry Houdini. Fitzharris performed virtual autopsies, experimented with blood samples, interviewed witnesses, and conducted real-time demonstrations in hopes of gleaning fresh insights. For his part, Teal is a well-known caricaturist and illustrator, best known for his work on the British TV series

Apple&#x27;s M5 has appeared in a benchmark leak with Geekbench
It posted an impressive single-core result for CPU performance, beating out Qualcomm&#x27;s powerful Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme SoC
The M5 is also shown getting the better of some beefy desktop CPUs, but we need to tread carefully here
If you were wondering how fast
Apple&#x27;s new M5 chip
might be, the answer is pretty nippy indeed, going by the grapevine.
As
Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports
, the M5, which is the engine of the
new MacBook Pro 14-inch
(and refreshed
iPad Pro
as well as the
Vision Pro
), is actually faster
than
Qualcomm&#x27;s new Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme
for single-core performance, based on a leaked Geekbench result that Tech Info highlighted on X.

Sprinkle on some seasoning, but as you can see in the above post, the comparison on X is between the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with M5 chip (10-core), where the laptop wins out - showing the advantages of better cooling and thermals with a notebook chassis. The M5 in the MacBook Pro is shown running at 4.61GHz compared to 4.43GHz in the iPad Pro.</div>
