                <div class="summary">Apart from antivirus apps, the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been business to business, with regular internet users left on their own to protect themselves. And older people, who did not grow up with the internet and smartphones, are perhaps the most vulnerable.
ZoraSafe
, a startup founded by sisters Catherine Karow and Ellie King Karow wants to step in and help them out. Their idea is to create an app that not only protects older people against scammers and hackers, but also teaches them how to stay safe through gamified microlearning, as Catherine and Ellie told TechCrunch ahead of the
TechCrunch Disrupt
conference, where ZoraSafe will be part of
Startup Battlefield.
The app is not out yet, but Catherine and Ellie expect to launch it in a month. They said it will cost $12.99 a month for individual subscribers, and a higher rate for family and group plans.
The first version of the app, Catherine explained in a phone call, will have several features, such as a mode to scan QR codes for malware or phishing, the ability to send suspicious SMS text messages and emails to ZoraSafe to get them checked out, and a feature to share a known scam or threat with the app so it can be added to a database to help other users.
“We’re trying to incentivize social sharing of scams, so we can also alert the entire Zora network at once, so one person is alerted by that scam, and then we can make sure everyone in that community is protected immediately,” Catherine said.
Future releases will also include a feature that will allow users to get ZoraSafe to join a suspicious phone call, so the company’s AI system can detect if it’s a scam or a deepfake call. In that case, however, the app will not be listening to or recording the calls, according to Catherine.
Once the app detects a threat, it will spin up a chat that will explain to the user what that threat was and teach them how to spot and deal with similar situations in the future, Ellie said.</div>

We keep talking about AI agents, but do we ever know what they are?
Sean Falconer, Confluent
October 12, 2025
Imagine you do two things on a Monday morning.
First, you ask a chatbot to summarize your new emails. Next, you ask an AI tool to figure out why your top competitor grew so fast last quarter. The
AI silently gets to work
. It scours financial reports, news articles and social media sentiment. It cross-references that data with your internal sales numbers, drafts a strategy outlining three potential reasons for the competitor&#x27;s success and schedules a 30-minute meeting with your team to present its findings.
We&#x27;re calling both of these &quot;
AI agents
,&quot; but they represent worlds of difference in intelligence, capability and the level of trust we place in them. This ambiguity creates a fog that makes it difficult to build, evaluate, and safely govern these powerful new tools. If we can&#x27;t agree on what we&#x27;re building, how can we know when we&#x27;ve succeeded?
This post won&#x27;t try to sell you on yet another definitive framework. Instead, think of it as a survey of the current landscape of agent autonomy, a map to help us all navigate the terrain together.
What are we even talking about? Defining an &quot;AI agent&quot;
Before we can measure an agent&#x27;s autonomy, we need to agree on what an &quot;agent&quot; actually is. The most widely accepted starting point comes from the foundational textbook on AI, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig’s
“
Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
.”
They define an agent as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. A thermostat is a simple agent: Its sensor perceives the room temperature, and its actuator acts by turning the heat on or off.
ReAct Model for AI Agents (Credit: Confluent)
That classic definition provides a solid mental model.</div>

Here’s how it works
.
(Image credit: Humbird Kickstarter)
Humbird 3 doubles Thunderbolt bandwidth, pushing up to 120Gbps in single-display mode
The CNC-machined aluminum body gives this eGPU dock a desktop-class structural finish
Its modular PCIe slot enables seamless GPU, SSD, or workstation switching
The Humbird 3 has entered the eGPU market with a mix of bold promises and elegant design choices.
Presented as the world’s first “desktop Thunderbolt 5 eGPU dock,” it claims to deliver
workstation
-grade speed and versatility in a body slimmer than most gaming laptops.
With its 500W GaN power system, integrated 1-inch LCD screen,
SSD
slot, and a full array of ports, the device appears ready to replace multiple desktop accessories at once.
You may like
This is the world&#x27;s smallest eGPU dock with a built-in 650W PSU - but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be comfortable with my $1,999 Geforce RTX 5090 GPU exposed to the elements
This is the weirdest &#x27;eGPU&#x27; setup I&#x27;ve seen so far in 2025: this one has a strange mini PC holder and up to 150W Thunderbolt 5 power delivery
This cheap eGPU docking station uses TB5, but you will need an external power supply to get it working
A leap in bandwidth and performance claims
At its core, the Humbird 3 uses
Intel
’s JHL9480 controller, which reportedly doubles the bandwidth from 40Gbps to 80Gbps and can reach up to 120Gbps in single-display mode.
The company describes it as the first Thunderbolt 5 dock capable of fully supporting external GPUs, and it is very thin, appearing like a pocket device.</div>

Spooky season is upon us, and traditional horror films like
Bring Her Back
(excellently gruesome) or
The Evil Dead
(stone cold classic) are obvious choices for a cozy movie night at home. But, if you’re looking for something that’s a bit more weird than wicked to get you in the
Halloween spirit
, I highly recommend the 1977 fantasy horror film
House
.
Describing
House
is an exercise in futility. Here’s the basic plot: A girl goes to spend the summer with her aunt after her widower father brings home a creepily sedate woman and declares that he intends to marry her.</div>

Gameplay Group International
We can finally answer the question of who wins in a fight between
prime Aang
and prime Korra.
Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game
, which is a working title, was announced at New York Comic Con and already has a release date of summer 2026. The developer, Gameplay Group International, revealed a trailer with some &quot;pre-alpha footage&quot; that resembles
Street Fighter
but with our favorite characters from the
Avatar franchise
.
According to the
Steam page
, the game will offer 12 characters at launch and introduce more on a seasonal basis. While the gameplay still looks like a rough draft, the developer has already detailed a unique fighting system, which includes a &quot;flow system&quot; and support characters that enable special moves.
Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game
will also have the &quot;energy of classic fighting games&quot; and was made with a focus on &quot;fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity.&quot; Along with combo trials and a gallery mode, the game will have crossplay and be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam.
For those not passionate about fighting games,
the upcoming release will also feature some original content through its single-player campaign. Alternatively, you can wait for Paramount&#x27;s &quot;
AAA RPG
&quot; based on the cartoon with no concrete release date. As for
Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game
, there&#x27;s a lot of promise here with the franchise&#x27;s diverse cast of characters and the developer&#x27;s experience with other fighting games. At the very least, it&#x27;s not the same developer that gave us the very forgettable
Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance
game.</div>

Thinking Machines Lab co-founder Andrew Tulloch heads to Meta
Thinking Machines Lab
, the AI startup led by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost one of its co-founders to Meta.
The Wall Street Journal reports
that AI researcher Andrew Tulloch announced his departure to employees in a message on Friday. A Thinking Machine Labs spokesperson confirmed Tulloch’s departure to the WSJ, saying he “has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.”
Back in August, the WSJ reported that
Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive AI recruiting blitz
included an offer to acquire Thinking Machines Lab — and when that failed, Zuckerberg reportedly tried to lure Tulloch with a compensation package that could have been worth up to $1.5 billion over at least six years. (At the time, a Meta spokesperson said that the WSJ’s description of the offer was “inaccurate and ridiculous.”)
Tulloch previously worked at OpenAI and Facebook’s AI Research Group.

                <div class="summary">When dirt meets data: ScottsMiracle-Gro saved $150M using AI
James Thomason
October 11, 2025
How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage
For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”
Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.
The AI revolution finds an unexpected leader
Enterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.
Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.
A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil science
Baxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.
“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023.</div>

Why doesn’t
Cards Against Humanity
print its game in the US? It’s complicated.
Price, quality, speed, and relationships all matter.

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) this week
announced its newest stunt
: a &quot;Cards Against Humanity Explains the Joke&quot; edition that ditches the game&#x27;s rules and adds explanatory notes to each card in the box. This makes the project &quot;informational material&quot; rather than a &quot;game,&quot; and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship.
While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week&#x27;s news did raise a question I&#x27;ve heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn&#x27;t it print the game in the US? I mean, it&#x27;s just a box of cards! How hard can it be?
In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it&#x27;s often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).
Earlier this year, for instance, I
quoted two board game designers
who had looked into US production and found it infeasible.</div>

Topfeel G1 and G1 Pro power both the GPU and the mini PC through one shared supply
Aluminum frames and dual-fan support make the Pro model stand out
OCulink connection ensures strong GPU bandwidth without proprietary limitations or bottlenecks
Topfeel, a Chinese manufacturer best known for its oddly memorable name, has entered the external graphics market with two new OCulink eGPU docks, the G1 and G1 Pro.
Designed to boost the performance of
mini PCs
, these docks bring desktop-level graphics power to compact systems.
Rather than acting as simple expansion boxes, they can physically host both a
GPU
and a mini PC in one setup, turning them into a unified, small-scale computing unit.

This mini PC has two 10Gb Ethernet LAN ports, a fingerprint reader, and can even connect to an external GPU - so remind me again why we need a full desktop PC?
This ultra slim mini PC is essentially a Core i9 laptop with an RTX 5070 laptop GPU, but sans a battery, keyboard, and screen
This is the weirdest &#x27;eGPU&#x27; setup I&#x27;ve seen so far in 2025: this one has a strange mini PC holder and up to 150W Thunderbolt 5 power delivery
Turning compact PCs into performance stations
The built-in power system can supply both the mini PC and the graphics card at the same time, allowing the combined setup to run as a self-contained computing unit.
The G1 and G1 Pro both rely on the OCulink (PCIe 4.0 x4) interface, ensuring full compatibility with standard desktop GPUs rather than locking users into proprietary connections.</div>

Apple’s Clips video editing app is no more. It
debuted in 2017
as a way to stitch together videos with music, text, and filters with a clear focus on
sharing to social media
. Over the years Apple added
AR features
and more advanced
video editing tools
. But recently updates had slowed to a trickle.
Apple finally decided to pull the plug though, removing Clips from the App Store. The company also updated its
support page
to state clearly that “the Clips app is no longer being updated, and will no longer be available for download for new users as of October 10, 2025.” If you’ve already downloaded the app you can continue to use it on iOS and iPadOS. But it might also be a good idea to save any videos directly to your Photos library.</div>
