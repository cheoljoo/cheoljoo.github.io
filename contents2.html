                <div class="summary">Tech YouTuber
Marques Brownlee
, or MKBHD, announced on Monday that his phone wallpaper app
Panels
is shutting down.
Fans had high hopes for Brownlee’s foray into app development, given his reputation as an eagle-eyed tech reviewer who has amassed more than 20 million followers on YouTube. He’s so influential that some blamed his commentary on Humane AI and
Fisker
for those companies’ eventual failures (we think the real issue is that you shouldn’t raise
$230 million
if you have no product). Yet from the time Brownlee
launched Panels
in September 2024, the app struggled to find an audience of its own.
“We knew it was niche, but we made mistakes in making our first app, and ultimately, we weren’t able to turn it into the vision I had,” Brownlee said in an
unlisted YouTube video
. In a
blog post
, he added that “the makeup of the development team changed,” and he was unable to find the right collaborators to grow the app.
Brownlee was inspired to create Panels because when he posts video reviews of phones, tablets, and computers, fans always point out how stunning his wallpapers and lock screens are. When he first
announced
the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd…” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.”
Panels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog.
Thanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked #1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum.</div>

DeepSeek just dropped two insanely powerful AI models that rival GPT-5 and they&#x27;re totally free
Michael Nuñez

Chinese artificial intelligence startup
DeepSeek
released two powerful new AI models on Sunday that the company claims match or exceed the capabilities of OpenAI&#x27;s
GPT-5
and Google&#x27;s
Gemini-3.0-Pro
— a development that could reshape the competitive landscape between American tech giants and their Chinese challengers.
The Hangzhou-based company launched
DeepSeek-V3.2
, designed as an everyday reasoning assistant, alongside DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, a high-powered variant that achieved gold-medal performance in four elite international competitions: the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Olympiad in Informatics, the ICPC World Finals, and the China Mathematical Olympiad.
The release carries profound implications for American technology leadership. DeepSeek has once again demonstrated that it can produce frontier AI systems despite U.S. export controls that
restrict China&#x27;s access to advanced Nvidia chips
— and it has done so while making its models freely available under an open-source MIT license.
&quot;People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough but we came back much bigger,&quot; wrote
Chen Fang
, who identified himself as a contributor to the project, on X (formerly Twitter). The release drew swift reactions online, with one user declaring: &quot;
Rest in peace, ChatGPT
.&quot;
How DeepSeek&#x27;s sparse attention breakthrough slashes computing costs
At the heart of the new release lies
DeepSeek Sparse Attention
, or DSA — a novel architectural innovation that dramatically reduces the computational burden of running AI models on long documents and complex tasks.
Traditional AI attention mechanisms, the core technology allowing language models to understand context, scale poorly as input length increases.</div>

It’s been over 10 years since the launch of
the excellent
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
, and nearly four years since
the announcement
of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete
Witcher
games in a short six-year window.
In
a recent earnings call
, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine
in 2022
. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of
widespread technical issues with the console versions of
Cyberpunk 2077
, which CDPR later
blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”
“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [
The Witcher 4
] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call.</div>

Cyber Monday is still going strong – in fact, I’ve just spotted a brilliant Cyber Monday deal on one of the best tech products I’ve ever bought.
Amazon is offering the excellent Logitech Ergo K860 ergonomic keyboard for just £59.99 (was £114.99)
, knocking this excellent split keyboard down to just over half price.

I bought the Ergo K860 at full price a few years ago after writing a few too many uni essays on a cramped laptop keyboard and waking up with pains in my shoulders and back, and have loved its comfortable split layout and large wrist pad ever since.
It’s still my go-to for long writing sessions and is holding up well after years of use and thousands of words, making this
Cyber Monday deal
perhaps the easiest shopping recommendation I’ll make all year.

                <div class="summary">On November 30, 2022, OpenAI introduced a new product to the world, innocuously
describing it
as “a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.”
It’s no hyperbole to suggest that ChatGPT subsequently transformed the worlds of business and tech, becoming enormously popular — it’s still in the number one spot on Apple’s free app rankings today — while also serving as the catalyst for a flood of generative AI products.
It’s even made people
suspicious of the em dash
, which no chatbot will ever take from me.
In fact, “Empire of AI” author
Karen Hao argued in a recent interview with TechCrunch
that OpenAI has “already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation-state in the world,” and is now “rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives.”
There may be even more dramatic changes to come. Charlie Warzel
wrote in The Atlantic
that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.”
“Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.”
Of course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.”

Ontology is the real guardrail: How to stop AI agents from misunderstanding your business
Dattaraj Rao, Persistent Systems
November 30, 2025
Enterprises are investing billions of dollars in AI agents and infrastructure to transform business processes. However, we are seeing limited success in real-world applications, often due to the inability of agents to truly
understand business data
, policies and processes.
While we manage the integrations well with technologies like API management, model context protocol (MCP) and others, having agents truly understand the “meaning” of data in the context of a given businesis a different story. Enterprise data is mostly siloed into disparate systems in structured and unstructured forms and needs to be analyzed with a domain-specific business lens.s
As an example, the term “customer” may refer to a different group of people in a Sales CRM system, compared to a finance system which may use this tag for paying clients. One department might define “product” as a SKU; another may represent as a &quot;product&quot; family; a third as a marketing bundle.
Data about “product sales” thus varies in meaning without agreed upon relationships and definitions. For agents to combine data from multiple systems, they must understand different representations. Agents need to know what the data means in context and how to find the right data for the right process. Moreover, schema changes in systems and data quality issues during collection can lead to more ambiguity and inability of agents to know how to act when such situations are encountered.
Furthermore, classification of data into categories like PII (personally identifiable information) needs to be rigorously followed to maintain compliance with standards like GDPR and CCPA. This requires the data to be labelled correctly and agents to be able to understand and respect this classification.</div>

We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, from modern to ancient and all points in between. With that in mind, we’ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a
curated list of some of our favorites from GOG’s catalog
. At the end of every month, we’ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.
Twice a month, we’ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we’ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you’ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out
the earlier pieces in the series
!
Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’
Jill of the Jungle
illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.)
Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time.</div>

Windows 11 migration remains slow as companies continue relying on aging hardware fleets
Dell sees flat PC sales ahead while server demand shows clear growth
Memory prices rise sharply as manufacturers shift resources toward AI-focused components
Dell
is warning the
shift from Windows 10 to Windows 11
remains far behind expectations.
As part of its most recent financial results, the company revealed the current transition rate is ten to twelve points lower than the pace seen during the previous
operating system
phase-out.
For this reason, Dell expects flat PC sales next year, even though about 500 million PCs cannot run
Windows 11
due to hardware limitations.

Many of these systems remain functional enough that organizations have delayed replacement, Dell says, a mood which seems to affect every segment, from desktops to smaller systems such as a
mini PC
.
Dell reported stronger results from its server and networking units as orders for AI-focused systems reached more than twelve billion dollars in the last quarter.</div>
