For the past three months, Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro has held its ground as one of the most capable frontier models available. But in the fast-moving world of AI, three months is a lifetime — and competitors have not been standing still. Earlier today, Google released
Gemini 3.1 Pro
, an update that brings a key innovation to the company&#x27;s workhorse power model: three levels of adjustable thinking that effectively turn it into a lightweight version of Google&#x27;s specialized Deep Think reasoning system.</div>

Indie publisher and developer Finji has accused TikTok of using generative AI to alter the ads for its games on the platform without its knowledge or permission. Finji, which published indie darlings like
Night in the Woods
and
Tunic
,
said it only became aware of the seemingly modified ads after being alerted to them by followers of its official TikTok account.</div>

announced
on Wednesday a new integration with Spotify, bringing a seamless ticket-buying experience for Spotify users. Now, when Spotify users browse an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates, they will see ticket links powered by SeatGeek for concerts at these participating venues, allowing for a streamlined purchase process. Currently, the integration is available for a select group of venues where SeatGeek serves as the primary ticket seller. Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)
This is a strategic win for SeatGeek. With direct placement in the Spotify app, SeatGeek is positioned to reach millions of active music fans as they discover upcoming events, increasing the chances of converting listeners into ticket buyers. Image Credits:
SeatGeek
Although SeatGeek has made significant strides in the space, it continues to face competition from heavyweights Ticketmaster and AXS. These rivals command a greater share of the ticketing market, bolstered by long-term contracts with many top venues and event organizers. It’s
estimated
that Ticketmaster alone services 53 of the top 68 US arenas. Even Barclays Center, which switched from Ticketmaster to SeatGeek in 2021,
quickly reversed course
less than a year into a seven-year agreement and ended the deal to return to Ticketmaster. Notably, the latest partnership follows Spotify’s
announcement
that it has helped artists generate over $1 billion in ticket sales by linking fans with live events through its ticketing partners. The company works with more than 45
ticketing partners
, including Ticketmaster, AXS, Eventbrite, DICE, a...</div>

Alibaba dropped Qwen3.5
earlier this week, timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year, and the headline numbers alone are enough to make enterprise AI buyers stop and pay attention. The new flagship open-weight model — Qwen3.5-397B-A17B — packs 397 billion total parameters but activates only 17 billion per token. It is claiming benchmark wins against
Alibaba&#x27;s own previous flagship, Qwen3-Max
, a model the company itself has acknowledged exceeded one trillion parameters. The release marks a meaningful moment in enterprise AI procurement. For IT leaders evaluating AI infrastructure for 2026, Qwen 3.5 presents a different kind of argument: that the model you can actually run, own, and control can now trade blows with the models you have to rent. A New Architecture Built for Speed at Scale
The engineering story underneath Qwen3.5 starts with its ancestry. The model is a direct successor to last September&#x27;s experimental Qwen3-Next, an ultra-sparse MoE model that was previewed but widely regarded as half-trained. Qwen3.5 takes that architectural direction and scales it aggressively, jumping from 128 experts in the previous Qwen3 MoE models to 512 experts in the new release. The practical implication of this and a better attention mechanism is dramatically lower inference latency. Because only 17 billion of those 397 billion parameters are active for any given forward pass, the compute footprint is far closer to a 17B dense model than a 400B one — while the model can draw on the full depth of its expert pool for specialized reasoning. These speed gains are substantial. At 256K context lengths, Qwen 3.5 decodes 19 times faster than Qwen3-Max and 7.2 times faster than Qwen 3&#x27;s 235B-A22B model.</div>

This week, Apple released the first developer betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, macOS 26.4, and its other operating systems. On Tuesday, it followed those up with public beta versions of the same updates. Usually released around the midpoint between one major iOS release and the next, the *.4 updates to its operating system usually include a significant batch of new features and other refinements, and if the first beta is any indication, this year’s releases uphold that tradition. A new “Playlist Playground” feature will let Apple Music subscribers generate playlists with text prompts, and native support for video podcasts is coming to the Podcasts app. The
Creator Studio version
of the Freeform drawing and collaboration app is also available in the 26.4 updates, allowing subscribers to access stock images from Apple’s Content Hub and to insert AI-generated images. But we’ve spent time digging through the betas to identify some of the more below-the-surface improvements and changes that Apple is testing. Some of these changes won’t come to the public versions of the software until a later release; others may be removed or changed between now and when the 26.4 update is made available to the general public. But generally, Apple’s betas give us a good idea of what the final release will look like. One feature that hasn’t appeared in these betas? The new “more intelligent Siri” that ...</div>
