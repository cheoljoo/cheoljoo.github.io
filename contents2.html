Taco Bell is having second thoughts about relying on AI at the drive-through
Taco Bell’s chief digital officer says the company is having an “active conversation” about when to use and not to use AI.
The company has apparently rolled out voice AI-powered ordering at more than 500 drive-throughs, leading to unflattering viral moments like someone
ordering 18,000 water cups
in order to “bypass” the AI and get connected to a human server.
Chief Digital and Technology Officer
Dane Matthews told The Wall Street Journal
that even he has mixed experiences with technology: “Sometimes it lets me down, but sometimes it really surprises me.”
Overall, it sounds like Taco Bell is still deciding how broadly to deploy AI at the drive-through, with leeway for different franchisees to do things their own way. For example, rather than relying on AI exclusively, Matthews said it might make sense to have a human handle drive-through orders at busy restaurants with long lines.
“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,” he said.

Texas suit alleging anti-coal “cartel” of top Wall Street firms could reshape ESG
It’s a closely watched test of whether corporate alliances on climate efforts violate antitrust laws.

Since 2022, Republican lawmakers in Congress and state attorneys general have sent letters to major
banks
,
pension funds
,
asset managers
,
accounting firms
,
companies
,
nonprofits
, and
business alliances
, putting them on notice for potential antitrust violations and seeking information as part of the Republican pushback against “environmental, social and governance” efforts such as corporate climate commitments.
“This caused a lot of turmoil and stress obviously across the whole ecosystem,” said Denise Hearn, a senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. “But everyone wondered, ‘OK, when are they actually going to drop a lawsuit?’”
That
came in November
, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other Republican AGs, accusing three of the biggest asset managers on Wall Street—BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street—of running “an investment cartel” to depress the output of coal and boosting their revenues while pushing up energy costs for Americans. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission filed a supporting
brief
in May.
The overall pressure campaign aimed at what’s known as “ESG” is having an impact.</div>

The iconic floppy disk is reborn as a storage case for today&#x27;s terabyte-packing SD cards
From 1.44MB past to terabyte present, the new design bridges eras creatively
Fun artwork references glitch aesthetics and retro computing
Floppy disks are unquestionably a relic from the past, although they still keep resurfacing in unusual places - most recently, surfacing in the
American prison service
, and an enterprising YouTuber set out to
build a floppy disk from scratch
.
If you&#x27;re of a certain age, you&#x27;ll no doubt still remember the feeling of sliding a floppy disk into a computer, hearing that quiet click, and waiting as files loaded bit by bit. That memory will come rushing back with the Floppy Disk-Inspired SD Card Packaging, a design concept created by Indian industrial designer Ayushmaan Singh Jodha for SanDisk.
It takes the iconic 3.5-inch floppy and reimagines it as a different kind of storage device - as a case for today’s
SD cards
.

From megabytes to terabytes
Where a floppy once held 1.44MB, this design protects cards that now carry gigabytes or even terabytes.
The idea bridges eras of technology in a fun way, but with a serious practical purpose.</div>

No, a Windows update probably didn’t brick your SSD

For the last week or two,
reports
have been circulating that recent Windows 11 updates (specifically KB5063878 and KB5062660) were causing some SSDs using Phison controllers to fail. Tech influencers on
YouTube
and
TikTok
were quick to jump on the reports of corrupted data and disappearing drives, laying the blame squarely at Microsoft’s feet. We’re not saying any company is above lying to the public, and Microsoft has a
history
of
rocky
update
rollouts
, but both Microsoft and Phison claim they’ve been unable to recreate the issue.
Phison said it was made aware of reports that the Windows update was causing drives to fail on August 18th and began investigating the issue. Then it
issued a statement
on August 27th saying that after running over 2,200 test cycles totaling more than 4,500 hours it was, “unable to reproduce the reported issue, and no partners or customers have reported that the issue affected their drives at this time.</div>

What to read this weekend: Two thrilling horror novels in one
And the gritty new miniseries, The Voice Said Kill, from Image Comics.
Cheyenne MacDonald
Weekend Editor

These are some recently released titles we think are worth adding to your reading list. This week, we picked up the Saga Doubles release of Stephen Graham Jones&#x27;
Killer on the Road
and
The Babysitter Lives
, and the new Image Comics miniseries,
The Voice Said Kill
.
S&amp;S/Saga Press
Killer on the Road/The Babysitter Lives (Saga Doubles)
Once again (or twice, really, because this book is two novels in one), Stephen Graham Jones delivers on some really gripping, fun horror that spins some classic tropes into something unexpected. This double feature contains
The Babysitter Lives
and
Killer on the Road,
the first being a story about a night of babysitting gone horribly, supernaturally wrong on the eve of Halloween, and the latter a road trip from hell situation in which a hitchhiker-targeting serial killer sets his sights on a runaway teen and her friends.
The Babysitter Lives
was previously available as an audiobook exclusive, so fans may already be familiar with that one.
Killer on the Road
hooks you immediately with its &quot;Chapter 0&quot; cold open, which pretty much gives you a sense of how things are going to be from then on out (brutal). It&#x27;s wonderful in the gory, stressful, horrifying-but-also-humorous way SGJ does so well.
The Babysitter Lives
is a brutal and chaotic time, too, and it managed to genuinely give me the creeps when I stayed up way too late reading it. Without giving too much away, something ain&#x27;t right about the house this babysitter shows up to work at. These were so fun to read.</div>
