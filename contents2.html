TechCrunch Mobility
! The year in transportation started with a couple of bankruptcies —
Canoo
and
Nikola
— and now it’s ending with two more. Rad Power Bikes
is coming to an end — or at least a bankruptcy. The electric bike company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days. And then there is troubled lidar maker
Luminar
, which also
filed for bankruptcy
this week. The Luminar bankruptcy does not seem like a let’s-help-it-live-another-day type of situation. The Luminar filing, which occurred after months of
layoffs
, executive departures, and a
legal fight
with its largest customer, Volvo, notes the company plans to sell off the business. It has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed, senior reporter
Sean O’Kane
reported. Want to learn more? I recommend reading O’Kane’s piece that looks at how
Luminar’s doomed Volvo deal helped drag the company into bankruptcy
. Even though the year was bookended by some failures, that doesn’t mean 2025 wasn’t filled with innovation and growth. The emerging robotaxi industry has indeed
emerged
. With that I have noticed new kinds of autonomous vehicle-adjacent companies popping up, and I expect that to become a trend in 2026. The scale of robotaxis was largely driven by
Waymo’s
fast-paced growth, although
Zoox
and
Tesla
have also started to set up shop.</div>

Agent autonomy without guardrails is an SRE nightmare
João Freitas, PagerDuty

As AI use continues to evolve in large organizations, leaders are increasingly seeking the next development that will yield major ROI. The latest wave of this ongoing trend is the adoption of AI agents. However, as with any new technology, organizations must ensure they adopt AI agents in a responsible way that allows them to facilitate both speed and security. More than half
of organizations have already deployed AI agents to some extent, with more expecting to follow suit in the next two years. But many early adopters are now reevaluating their approach. Four-in-10 tech leaders regret not establishing a
stronger governance foundation
from the start, which suggests they adopted AI rapidly, but with margin to improve on policies, rules and best practices designed to ensure the responsible, ethical and legal development and use of AI. As AI adoption accelerates
, organizations must find the right balance between their exposure risk and the implementation of guardrails to ensure AI use is secure. Where do AI agents create potential risks? There are three principal areas of consideration for safer AI adoption. The first is
shadow AI
, when employees use unauthorized AI tools without express permission, bypassing approved tools and processes. IT should create necessary processes for experimentation and innovation to introduce more efficient ways of working with AI. While shadow AI has existed as long as AI tools themselves, AI agent autonomy makes it easier for unsanctioned tools to operate outside the purview of IT, which can introduce fresh security risks. Secondly, organizations must close gaps in AI ownership and accountability to prepare for incidents or processes gone wrong. The strength of AI agents lies in their autonomy.</div>

Razer Kishi V3 Pro review: Two-minute review
The
Razer
Kishi V3 Pro is a very capable
mobile controller
that comes with reliable and remappable inputs, a comfortable form factor, great software, and a very high price tag. It’s a top choice for those who want a console-style experience on the go thanks to its great analog triggers, full-size thumbsticks, and intuitive design, but doesn’t quite feel as sturdy as a dedicated standalone controller. With that said, the Kishi V3 Pro is reliable enough that it disappears into your hands once you get a game going, either from the home screen or the brilliant Razer Nexus app, which serves as a launcher as well as a home base for settings and calibration. It’s precise enough to give you a real edge in games like
Fortnite
and
Call of Duty
: Mobile
, and also works well in platformers like
Dadish 3D
as well as 2D classics like
Jetpack Joyride

is a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget. A power outage struck San Francisco on Saturday that blacked out about 130,000 customers at its peak,
according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company
, but also caused another problem: stranded Waymo vehicles. Posts all over social media showed the company’s autonomous SUVs sitting still in the streets and causing traffic jams.</div>

GuliKit&#x27;s $20 mod makes the ROG Xbox Ally&#x27;s joysticks drift-free
The plug-and-play upgrade means you won&#x27;t have to worry about your joysticks succumbing to the dreaded stick drift. Jackson Chen

There may not be any reports of
stick drift
with the
ROG Xbox Ally
yet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there won&#x27;t be. If you&#x27;d rather not end up with joysticks that have a mind of their own, GuliKit revealed its latest
TMR Electromagnet Joystick Modules
made specifically for your Xbox handheld. GuliKit said it worked directly with Asus to develop these joystick upgrades, which match the exact dimensions of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X&#x27;s stock sticks. The aftermarket accessories company previously designed a Hall effect
joystick upgrade kit
for the ROG Ally X, but GuliKit said this mod features electromagnetic joysticks that not only address stick drift but are also more precise, durable, and power-efficient. GuliKit even made the joystick upgrades easy to install since there&#x27;s no soldering required, and you can fine-tune the calibration in the handheld&#x27;s system settings. It may feel excessive to spend more money on a gaming handheld that can cost up to $1,000, but neither the ROG Xbox Ally nor Ally X comes with Hall effect or electromagnetic joysticks. GuliKit&#x27;s joystick upgrade is already available to US customers on its
Amazon storefront
for $19.99. Advertisement

                <div class="summary">Governor Kathy Hochul has signed the RAISE Act, positioning New York as the second U.S. state to enact major AI safety legislation. State lawmakers
passed RAISE Act
in June, but following lobbying from the tech industry,
Hochul proposed changes
to scale the bill back. The New York Times reports
that Hochul ultimately agreed to sign the original bill, while lawmakers agreed to make her requested changes next year. The bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours. It will also create a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development. If companies fail to submit safety reports or make false statements, they can be fined up to $1 million ($3 million for subsequent violations). California Governor Gavin Newsom
signed a similar safety bill
in September, which Hochul referenced in
her announcement
. “This law builds on California’s recently adopted framework, creating a unified benchmark among the country’s leading tech states as the federal government lags behind, failing to implement common-sense regulations that protect the public,” Hochul said. State Senator Andrew Gounardes, one of the bill’s sponsors,
posted
, “Big Tech thought they could weasel their way into killing our bill. We shut them down and passed the strongest AI safety law in the country.”

While Gemini 3 is still making waves, Google&#x27;s not taking the foot off the gas in terms of releasing new models. Yesterday, the
company released FunctionGemma
, a specialized 270-million parameter AI model designed to solve one of the most persistent bottlenecks in modern application development: reliability at the edge. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, FunctionGemma is engineered for a single, critical utility—translating natural language user commands into structured code that apps and devices can actually execute, all without connecting to the cloud. The release marks a significant strategic pivot for Google DeepMind and the Google AI Developers team. While the industry continues to chase trillion-parameter scale in the cloud, FunctionGemma is a bet on &quot;Small Language Models&quot; (SLMs) running locally on phones, browsers, and IoT devices. For AI engineers and enterprise builders, this model offers a new architectural primitive: a privacy-first &quot;router&quot; that can handle complex logic on-device with negligible latency. FunctionGemma is available immediately for download on
Hugging Face
and
Kaggle
. You can also see the model in action by downloading the Google AI Edge Gallery app on the Google Play Store. The Performance Leap
At its core, FunctionGemma addresses the &quot;execution gap&quot; in generative AI. Standard large language models (LLMs) are excellent at conversation but often struggle to reliably trigger software actions—especially on resource-constrained devices. According to Google’s internal &quot;Mobile Actions&quot; evaluation, a generic small model struggles with reliability, achieving only a 58% baseline accuracy for function calling tasks.</div>

How Europe’s new carbon tax on imported goods will change global trade

For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe. The
carbon border adjustment mechanism
(CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials. If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive. The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation. After a
trial phase
, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity. Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share.</div>

Hard drives still matter where capacity, cost efficiency and durability outweigh raw speed
Most modern hard drives are built for data centers, servers and specialized storage roles
Consumer hard drives are now rare, while enterprise, NAS and video drives dominate
Hard disk drives are often written off as legacy tech, but a closer look at what is still on sale tells a different story. After compiling a detailed list of 167 of the
best hard disk drives
worth buying, six clear points emerged about who is still making HDDs, what they’re building, and who they’re actually for. The first thing which stands out relates to brand. Western Digital has more drives on the list than anyone else, with 66 models spanning consumer, NAS, enterprise, and specialist categories. That range stretches from WD Blue consumer drives to WD Gold and Ultrastar models designed for data centers. You may like

The holidays have a way of sneaking up on us. One minute you’re trick-or-treating with your kids, and the next you’re panic shopping in a Buc-ee’s gift aisle. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With the right cheat sheet, you can keep the holiday spirit high and stress levels low. Fortunately, we did some planning on your behalf. As much as we love playing with the latest gadgets and gizmos here at
The Verge
, we also love recommending them. That’s why, after consulting with our expert team of writers and editors, we’ve compiled a medley of gift ideas that won’t be regifted come this time next year — from
noise-canceling earbuds
and
e-readers
to
retro-inspired Polaroid cameras
. Not every gift needs to be a grand gesture, though. Sure, a
new gaming handheld
makes for a great gift, but so does an
affordable power bank
