                <div class="summary">Social network Bluesky, which on Friday announced a new
milestone of 40 million users
, will soon start testing “dislikes” as a way to improve personalization on its main Discover feed and others.
The news was shared alongside a host of other
conversation control updates and changes
, which include smaller tweaks to replies, improved detection of toxic comments, and other ways to prioritize more relevant conversations to the individual user.
With the “dislikes” beta rolling out soon, Bluesky will take into account the new signal to improve user personalization. As users “dislike” posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked feeds, but also reply rankings.
The company explained the changes are designed to make Bluesky a place for more “fun, genuine, and respectful exchanges” — an edict that follows a month of unrest on the platform as some users
again criticized the platform over its moderation decisions
. While Bluesky is designed as a decentralized network where users run their own moderation, some subset of Bluesky users want the platform itself to ban bad actors and
controversial figures
instead of leaving it up to the users to block them.
Bluesky, however, wants to focus more on the tools it provides users to control their own experience.
Today, this includes things like moderation lists that let users quickly block a group of people they don’t want to interact with, content filter controls, muted words, and the ability to subscribe to other moderation service providers. Bluesky also lets users detach quote posts to limit unwanted attention, which has long influenced the toxic culture of “
dunking
” on X (formerly Twitter).
In addition to dislikes, the company says it’s testing a mix of ranking updates, design changes, and other feedback tools to improve the conversations ...</div>

Inside Celosphere 2025: Why there’s no ‘enterprise AI’ without process intelligence
VB Staff
October 31, 2025
Presented by Celonis
AI adoption is accelerating, but results often lag expectations. And enterprise leaders are under pressure to prove measurable ROI from the AI solutions — especially as the use of autonomous agents rises and global tariffs disrupt supply chains.
The issue isn’t the AI itself, says Alex Rinke, co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, a global leader in process intelligence. “To succeed, enterprise AI needs to understand the context of a business’s processes — and how to improve them,” he explains. Without this business context, AI risks becoming, as Rinke puts it, “just an internal social experiment.”
Next week’s
Celosphere 2025
will tackle the AI ROI challenge head-on. The three-day event brings together customer strategies, hands-on workshops, and live demonstrations, highlighting enhancements to the Celonis Process Intelligence (PI) Platform that help enterprises harness ‘enterprise AI,’ powered by PI, to continuously improve operations, creating measurable business value at scale.
Focus on measurable ROI
The event’s focus on achieving AI ROI reflects three challenges facing technology and business leaders moving from pilot to production: obsolete systems, break-neck industry change, and agentic AI.
According to Gartner
, 64% of board members now view AI as a top-three priority — yet only 10% of organizations report meaningful financial returns.
Celonis customers are bucking that trend. A
Forrester Total Economic Impact study
found organizations using its platform achieved 383% ROI over three years, with payback in just six months. One company improved sales order automation from 33% to 86%, saving $24.5 million. The study estimated $44.1 million in total benefits over three years, driven by faster automation, reduced inefficien...</div>

The road to the second flight of Blue Origin’s heavy-lifting New Glenn rocket got a lot clearer Thursday night with a success test-firing of the launcher’s seven main engines on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.
Standing on a seaside launch pad, the New Glenn rocket ignited its seven BE-4 main engines at 9:59 pm EDT Thursday (01:59 UTC Friday). The engines burned for 38 seconds while the rocket remained firmly on the ground, according to a
social media post
by Blue Origin.
The hold-down firing of the first stage engines was the final major test of the New Glenn rocket before launch day. Blue Origin previously test-fired the rocket’s second-stage engines. Officials have not announced a target launch date, but sources tell Ars the rocket could be ready for liftoff as soon as November 9.
“Love seeing New Glenn’s seven BE-4 engines come alive! Congratulations to Team Blue on today’s hotfire,” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp,
posted on X
.
Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, said the engines operated at full power for 22 seconds, generating nearly 3.9 million pounds of thrust. Limp said engineers extended this test-firing and shut down some of the BE-4 engines to simulate the booster’s landing burn sequence, which Blue Origi...</div>

Robin Hood wasn&#x27;t what I expected, and that&#x27;s both a good and bad thing. While taking Rob&#x27;s story in a new direction feels refreshing and enriching, there&#x27;s a lot of shock-factor tacked on for no good reason.
Pros
+
Robin Hood&#x27;s new story feels like something we&#x27;ve not seen before
+
Leads Jack Patten and Lauren McQueen are impressive for newbies
+
My favorite Connie Nielsen role since Gladiator
+
Every episode cliffhanger is a knockout
+
Gets many of the core storytelling basics down pat
Cons
-
Production quality bounces between high and low-end
-
Far too many gratuitous sex scenes
-
Some episodes feel like obvious filler
-

Don&#x27;t tell
Amazon
, but my heart sank when I first heard that yet another
Robin Hood
adaptation was coming to
MGM+
. But after watching it, I&#x27;ve mostly been won over. As it turns out, you can teach an old dog new tricks.
I&#x27;ve always been of the firm belief that the 2010
Robin Hood
movie starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett is the best we&#x27;ve had (I didn&#x27;t grow up watching the animated
Disney movie
from 1973, so I&#x27;m discounting that). However, newcomer Jack Patten in the titular role and Lauren McQueen as Marian are a breath of fresh air.
Straight off the bat, the new series has taken a huge risk by putting two unknown actors in its lead roles, and this is a large part of why I think the 10-episode series is so successful. They&#x27;re perfectly counterbalanced by heavyweights Sean Bean (Sheriff ...</div>

How to cancel or pause your YouTube TV subscription
Don&#x27;t pay for a subscription service that doesn&#x27;t have the channels you want.

While YouTube TV is Engadget&#x27;s pick for
the best live TV streaming service
, it isn&#x27;t for everyone, especially right now. Google and Disney&#x27;s ongoing carriage dispute means subscribers
don&#x27;t have access
to channels like ABC and ESPN, and
recent price hikes
means paying for YouTube TV now costs a minimum of $83 a month.
Whether you&#x27;ve
switched to another service
to hold on to your favorite channels or just want to save some money, there&#x27;s ample reasons to cancel or pause your subscription right now. Here&#x27;s what you should know about cancelling or pausing your YouTube TV subscription.
How to cancel your subscription on mobile and web
The process for canceling your YouTube TV subscription is the same whether you&#x27;re doing it inside the YouTube TV app or from a web or mobile browser, provided you&#x27;re paying Google directly for access.

Your subscription is now cancelled and you&#x27;ll be able to enjoy access to live TV until the end of your current payment period. Any shows or movies you&#x27;ve recorded will be saved in your account for 21 days, after which they&#x27;ll be deleted. In a support article, Google says it&#x27;ll also save your preferences in case you want to resubscribe and start recording content again. The company &quot;may store limited info (such as your home zip code)&quot; for fraud prevention purposes, as well.

Canva
launched its own design model on Thursday that understands different layers and formats today to power its features. The company also introduced new product forms, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to create with its coding tool for sheets to make widgets for getting repeatable insights.
Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its elements, that would generate designs with editable layers and objects as compared to a flat image. It said the model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.
“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call.
“What we’ve found is that where people want to be is the ability to really marry this idea of starting with a prompt and getting far, but also being able to iterate directly themselves.”
Infusing more AI features into Canva
Earlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has
a chat-like interface for generating new media
items using prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available across screens, including the design and elements tabs.

Users can also mention the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allow you to copy the art style of a design.
Earlier this year, the company added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it’s connecting these two products, allowing users to make use of data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.</div>

Why IT leaders should pay attention to Canva’s ‘imagination era’ strategy
Taryn Plumb
October 30, 2025
The rise of AI marks a critical shift away from decades defined by information-chasing and a push for more and more compute power.
Canva co-founder and CPO Cameron Adams refers to this dawning time as the “imagination era.” Meaning: Individuals and enterprises must be able to turn creativity into
action with AI
.
Canva hopes to position itself at the center of this shift with a sweeping new suite of tools. The company’s new Creative Operating System (COS) integrates AI across every layer of content creation, creating a single, comprehensive creativity platform rather than a simple, template-based design tool.
“We’re entering a new era where we need to rethink how we achieve our goals,” said Adams. “We’re enabling people’s imagination and giving them the tools they need to take action.”
An &#x27;engine&#x27; for creativity
Adams describes Canva’s platform as a three-layer stack: The top Visual Suite layer containing designs, images and other content; a collaborative Canva AI plane at center; and a foundational proprietary model holding it all up.
At the heart of Canva’s strategy is its Creative Operating System (COS) underlying. This “engine,” as Adams describes it, integrates documents, websites, presentations, sheets, whiteboards, videos, social content, hundreds of millions of photos, illustrations, a rich sound library, and numerous templates, charts, and branded elements.
The COS is getting a 2.0 upgrade, but the crucial advance is the “middle, crucial layer” that fully integrates AI and makes it accessible throughout various workflows, Adams explained. This gives creative and technical teams a single dashboard for generating, editing and launching all types of content.</div>

We’re a few weeks away from the debut of the fifth and final season of
Stranger Things
—at least the first of three parts of it—and Netflix has dropped one doozy of a trailer that shows things looking pretty bleak for our small-town heroes of Hawkins.
(Spoilers for prior seasons below.)
As
previously reported
, S4
ended with
Vecna—the Big Bad behind it all—opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We’re getting a time jump for S5, but in a way, we’re coming full circle, since the events coincide with the third anniversary of Will’s original disappearance in S1. The fifth season will have eight episodes, and each one will be looong—akin to eight feature-length films. Per the official premise:
The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.</div>

Bending Spoons announces deal to buy AOL for $1.5bn
Iconic Internet provider had been part of Yahoo
Latest entry to the Bending Spoons stable - but what will it do with AOL?
For many of us, AOL is a relic of the golden age of the Internet, but it turns out the company is still alive and thriving - and is still an attractive proposition for investment.
Italian software company Bending Spoons has
revealed
AOL will be the next big addition to its portfolio, at the cost of around $1.5 billion.
AOL does still offer a web portal and an
email service
for users, and recently hit the headlines for
shutting down its dial-up internet offering
in August 2025.

AOL + Bending Spoons
Bending Spoons has snapped up a series of well-known software names in recent years, including the likes of
WeTransfer
,
Evernote
and Vimeo, and says it has no plans to shut down AOL or spin off its tools.
The company claims AOL is still one of the top ten most-used email providers in the world today, with &quot;a highly retained customer base counting around 8 million daily and 30 million monthly active users&quot;.
“AOL is an iconic, beloved business that’s in good health, has stood the test of time, and we believe has unexpressed potential,” said Bending Spoons CEO and co-founder, Luca Ferrari.</div>
