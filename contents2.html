                <div class="summary">Summary of the article: Senator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a
bill
on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.”
“Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.”
The bill, dubbed SB 287, comes in the wake of
President Trump’s recent executive order
directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children.
In over the past year, lawsuits filed by
families
whose children
died by suicide
after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently
passed SB 243
, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users.
While the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group
PIRG Education Fund warned
that toys like Kumma – a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot – could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics.
NBC News found
that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at time...</div>

How Ralph Wiggum went from &#x27;The Simpsons&#x27; to the biggest name in AI right now
Carl Franzen

In the fast-moving world of AI development, it is rare for a tool to be described as both &quot;a meme&quot; and AGI, artificial generalized intelligence, the &quot;holy grail&quot; of a model or system that can reliably outperform humans on economically valuable work.
Yet, that is exactly where t
he Ralph Wiggum plugin for Claude Code
now sits.
Named after the infamously high-pitched, hapless yet persistent character on &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; this newish tool (released in summer 2025) — and the philosophy behind it — has set the developer community on X (formerly Twitter) into a tizzy of excitement over the last few weeks.
For power users of Anthropic’s hit agentic, quasi-autonomous coding platform
Claude Code
, Wiggum represents a shift from &quot;chatting&quot; with AI to managing autonomous &quot;night shifts.&quot;
It is a crude but effective step toward agentic coding, transforming the AI from a pair programmer into a relentless worker that doesn’t stop until the job is done.
Origin Story: A Tale of Two Ralphs
To understand the &quot;Ralph&quot; tool is to understand a new approach toward improving autonomous AI coding performance — one that relies on brute force, failure, and repetition as much as it does on raw intelligence and reasoning.
Because Ralph Wiggum is not merely a Simpsons character anymore; it is a methodology born on a goat farm and refined in a San Francisco research lab, a divergence best documented in the conversations between its creator and the broader developer community.
The story begins in roughly May 2025 with
Geoffrey Huntley
, a longtime open source software developer who pivoted to raising goats in rural Australia.
Huntley was frustrated by a fundamental limitation in the agentic coding workflow: the &quot;human-in-the-loop&quot; bo...</div>

Not only does it appear that OpenAI has lost its fight to keep news organizations from digging through 20 million ChatGPT logs to find evidence of copyright infringement—but also OpenAI now faces calls for sanctions and demands to retrieve and share potentially millions of deleted chats long thought of as untouchable in the litigation.
On Monday, US District Judge Sidney Stein
denied
objections that OpenAI raised, claiming that Magistrate Judge Ona Wang failed to adequately balance the privacy interests of ChatGPT users who are not involved in the litigation when ordering OpenAI to produce 20 million logs.
Instead, OpenAI wanted Stein to agree that it would be much less burdensome to users if OpenAI ran search terms to find potentially infringing outputs in the sample. That way, news plaintiffs would only get access to chats that were relevant to its case, OpenAI suggested.
But Stein found that Wang appropriately weighed ChatGPT users’ privacy interests when ordering OpenAI to produce the logs. For example, to shield ChatGPT users, the total number of logs shared was substantially reduced from tens of billions to 20 million, he wrote, and OpenAI has stripped all identifying information from any chats that will be shared.
Stein further agreed that news plaintiffs needed access to the entire sample because, as Wang wrote, even “output logs that do not contain reproductions of News Plaintiffs’ works may still be re...</div>

Crimson Collective claims to have stolen PII on 1M+ Brightspeed customers, including names, emails, phone numbers, and partial payment data
Brightspeed has not confirmed the breach, saying it is investigating reports of a cybersecurity event
The company, headquartered in Charlotte, NC, operates fiber broadband across 20 states and serves millions of premises
One of the biggest fiber broadband companies in the United States, Brightspeed, is said to be investigating a potential breach and data theft affecting more than a million customers.
Last weekend, a hacking group calling itself the Crimson Collective posted a new message on its Telegram channel, notifying their followers about the attack:
&quot;If anyone has someone working at BrightSpeed, tell them to read their mails fast! We have in our hands over 1m+ residential user PII&#x27;s,&quot; the group was cited saying. It also added that it will release samples on Monday night, “letting them some time first to answer to us.&quot;

It says a lot about the current moment when one of the world’s largest EV sellers shows up at the world’s biggest electronics show to announce not a new, more affordable model or a cool futuristic concept car,
but a humanoid robot
. And one
we’ve seen already
.
Hyundai’s decision to use its CES keynote to tout Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot sends a pretty clear message about how the auto industry is absorbing the bad news about EVs in the United States in 2025, and where it thinks things are heading in the new year. EVs...</div>

Google&#x27;s Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds are
on sale for $165 via Amazon
. That&#x27;s a nice discount of $64, which breaks down to 28 percent. There is a spot of bad news. The deal only applies to the hazel colorway. Other colors are discounted, but they aren&#x27;t as cheap. It&#x27;s not as if the hazel is hideous. These are standard dark brown-hued earbuds.
The device made our list of the
best wireless earbuds
, and this is particularly true for those tied into the Pixel ecosystem. These earbuds are on the smaller side and, more importantly, comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They also manage to
deliver pristine audio
, as we were fans of the punchy bass, full mids and crisp highs on offer.

The battery lasts for 30 hours when you include return trips to the charging case, at around eight hours a pop. They offer multipoint Bluetooth that switches between audio sources with just a single button press. There&#x27;s an app for keeping an eye on battery levels and ANC levels.

The primary downside when these were first released was the high price tag, which has been alleviated by this sale. Beyond that, there&#x27;s really just one nitpick. Smaller earbuds translate to a smaller touch panel, which requires precision to operate.

                <div class="summary">LEGO has unveiled its new SMART Play system at CES, introducing interactive and responsive LEGOs that do not require screens. The system features a 2x4 SMART Brick, SMART Tag tiles, and SMART Minifigures. These components can sense nearby SMART Tags, which have unique digital IDs that dictate the Bricks&#x27; and Minifigures&#x27; actions. For instance, a SMART Brick in a helicopter set will light up and make propeller sounds, with an accelerometer ensuring sounds and lights align with play movements. The SMART Bricks are powered by a patented ASIC chip, utilizing near-field magnetic positioning, a miniature speaker, accelerometer, and LED array. LEGO also developed BrickNet, a Bluetooth-based protocol for multiple SMART Bricks to interact, featuring enhanced encryption and privacy controls. The system is designed for easy setup, with no screens involved, and its first two Star Wars-themed sets are set to launch on March 1st, with preorders opening soon.</div>

                <div class="summary">The Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi has released Falcon H1R 7B, a 7-billion parameter AI model that challenges the conventional belief that larger models are necessary for better reasoning. Falcon H1R 7B utilizes a hybrid architecture, integrating the Mamba state-space model (SSM) architecture with standard Transformer attention layers, allowing it to outperform models nearly seven times its size, such as Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen and Nvidia&#x27;s Nemotron. This release signifies a shift in the open-weight AI ecosystem towards architectural efficiency and inference-time scaling rather than just raw parameter count. The model&#x27;s code is available on Hugging Face, and a live demo is accessible via Falcon Chat. TII has also published a comprehensive technical report detailing its approach and training methodology.</div>
