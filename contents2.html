                <div class="summary">It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom:
In 2019
, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come
in the form of Azure cloud credit
rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would
no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively
, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more in...</div>

We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, from modern to ancient and all points in between. With that in mind, we&#x27;ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a
curated list of some of our favorites from GOG&#x27;s catalog
. At the end of every month, we&#x27;ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.
Twice a month, we&#x27;ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we&#x27;ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you&#x27;ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out
the earlier pieces in the series
!
I love 4X games. I&#x27;ve tried other strategy game genres, but frankly, they don&#x27;t stick if they&#x27;re not first and foremost 4X games—at the heart of it, it must be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and yes, exterminating.
I suspect that the first 4X game most people played was some entry in the Civilization franchise—though certainly, a select few played precursors dating back to text-based games in the 1970s.
But for me, the title that kicked off my obsession was
Master of Orion II
(
MOO2
)—a game that has you develop and build up planets across a simple galaxy map, researching speculative future technologies, and ultimately wip...</div>

Here’s how it works

Crude GPU design showed random glitches whenever the system attempted memory writes
iNapGPU struggled with environmental noise from simple USB cables
A 12MHz counter overclocked to 20MHz caused constant instability
An obscure project on
GitHub
shows how a hardware hobbyist tried to construct what he called the “second world’s worst video card,” a text-mode
graphics card
using only TTL gates.
Working under the handle Leoneq, he released the “iNapGPU” repository to document his experiment.
His goal was to outdo
Ben Eater’s “world’s worst video card”
by making something even less practical.

A cautionary tale: hundreds of backers may have lost a total of more than $170,000 backing an 8-SSD subwoofer-like NAS mini PC project on a crowdfunding site
A Chinese GPU vendor you&#x27;ve never heard of wants to challenge Nvidia and AMD in the pro market with 24GB VRAM - surely it cannot succeed?
A dual Intel GPU graphics card with 48GB of VRAM has gone on sale for $1200 - now I wonder whether you could plug two of these into a workstation
A minimal design that still exceeded true VGA limits
Despite deliberately using crude methods, he could not reduce the output below a basic VGA resolution.
The project specifications list VGA output at 800 x 600 (actually SVGA) @60Hz, with an accessible resolution of 400 x 300 in monochrome.
The hardware was built from 21 integrated circuits, including counters, NAND gates, and an EPROM working with a small SRAM.
By treating a 1-Mbit EPROM as a 1-bit memory, Leoneq could load up to four character sets of 255 characters each.

For most of his career Larry Ellison has been content to quietly let Oracle be the company, behind the company, behind the technology that makes headlines. Its biggest products being cloud computing and database products that it sells to enterprise customers like DHL, Northwell Health, and Fanatics. But, now in his 80s, Ellison has begun a second act shifting from Silicon Valley pioneer, to media mogul.
Compared to many of the other people at the top of the

Business Insider
has obtained the guidelines that Meta contractors are reportedly now using to train its AI chatbots, showing how it&#x27;s attempting to more effectively address potential child sexual exploitation and prevent kids from engaging in age-inappropriate conversations. The company said in August
that it was updating the guardrails for its AIs
after
Reuters
reported that its policies allowed the chatbots to &quot;engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,&quot; which Meta said at the time was &quot;erroneous and inconsistent&quot; with its policies and removed that language.
The document, which
Business Insider
has shared an excerpt from, outlines what kinds of content are &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; for its AI chatbots. It explicitly bars content that &quot;enables, encourages, or endorses&quot; child sexual abuse, romantic roleplay if the user is a minor or if the AI is asked to roleplay as a minor, advice about potentially romantic or intimate physical contact if the user is a minor, and more. The chatbots can discuss topics such as abuse, but cannot engage in conversations that could enable or encourage it.
The
company&#x27;s AI chatbots
have been
the subject of
numerous
reports in recent months
that have raised concerns about their potential harms to children. The FTC in August launched
a formal inquiry into companion AI chatbots
not just from Meta, but other companies as well, including Alphabet, Snap, OpenAI and X.AI.

Beware coworkers who produce AI-generated ‘workslop’
Researchers at consulting firm
BetterUp Labs
, in collaboration with Stanford Social Media Lab, have coined a new term to describe low-quality, AI-generated work: “workslop.”
As defined in an article
published this week in the Harvard Business Review
, workslop is “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.”
BetterUp Labs researchers suggest that workslop could be one explanation for the 95% of organizations that have tried AI but report
seeing zero return on that investment
. Workslop, they write, can be “unhelpful, incomplete, or missing crucial context,” which just creates more work for everyone else.
“The insidious effect of workslop is that it shifts the burden of the work downstream, requiring the receiver to interpret, correct, or redo the work,” they write.
The researchers also conducted an
ongoing survey
of 1,150 full-time, U.S.-based employees, with 40% of respondents saying they’d received workslop in the past month.
To avoid this, the researchers say workplace leaders must “model thoughtful AI use that has purpose and intention” and “set clear guardrails for your teams around norms and acceptable use.”

We’re about a quarter of the way through the 21st century.
Summers across the global north are now defined by flash floods, droughts, heat waves, uncontainable wildfires, and intensifying named storms, exactly as predicted by Exxon scientists back in the 1970s. The United States secretary of health and human services advocates against using the most effective tool we have to fight the infectious diseases that have ravaged humanity for millennia. People are eagerly lapping up the misinformation spewed and disseminated by AI chatbots, which are only just getting started.
It is against this backdrop that a climate scientist and a vaccine developer teamed up to write
Science Under Siege
. It is about as grim as you’d expect.
Science Under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces That Threaten Our World
By Michael E. Mann and Peter J. Hotez
Michael Mann is a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who, in 1998, developed the notorious hockey stick graph, which demonstrated that global surface temperatures were roughly flat until around the year 1900, when they started rising precipitously (and have not stopped). Peter Hotez is a microbiologist and pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine whose group developed a low-cost, patent-free COVID-19 vaccine using public funds (i.e., not from a pharmaceutical company) and distributed it to almost a hundred million people in India and Indonesia.</div>

GL.iNet Comet Pro Remote KVM supports 4K video passthrough with responsive interaction at a distance
The device allows powering on a PC remotely using accessories
Remote 4K video passthrough keeps interaction smooth at 30 frames
GL.iNet, the company behind the
Comet (GL-RM1)
, an open source remote KVM running a Linux distribution, has launched the Comet Pro Remote KVM, a device which allows full control of computers,
workstations
, or servers entirely over Wi-Fi.
The crowdfunding for this project has drawn attention on
Kickstarter
, with over 3,700 backers pledging more than $600,000, far ahead of its funding $10,000 goal.
This small device is designed to deliver what the company calls ultra-low latency performance and strong security.

Video performance and wireless connectivity
The idea is that anyone can troubleshoot, work, or manage systems without being physically present.
The Comet Pro promises smooth remote interaction by enabling
4K
passthrough at 30 frames per second.
The system relies on H.264 encoding to keep latency in the 30 to 60 millisecond range, making remote control very responsive.
Unlike traditional solutions that rely on wired connections, the device supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi 6 bands, reducing dependence on LAN cabling.</div>

Nintendo’s first-party
Switch 2 Pro Controller
can’t be beaten when it comes to its breadth of features and comfort. But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The

These are some recently released titles we think are worth adding to your reading list. Get lost in Bitter Karella&#x27;s splatterpunk, cosmic fever dream,
Moonflow
, and the new zombie apocalypse comic,
Everything Dead &amp; Dying
.
Run For It
Moonflow
I am so glad the shockingly bright, fuzzy-blacklight-poster-style cover of this book grabbed my attention while I was doing work at a local cafe/bookstore the other day, because I otherwise might not have heard about
Moonflow
, and what a trip it turned out to be. Easily one of my favorite reads this year.
Moonflow
is, as author Bitter Karella described it in a recent
interview
, &quot;Psychedelic trans cosmic fungal splatterpunk.&quot; It follows Sarah, a trans woman who grows and sells trippy mushrooms, on a desperate search for a mushroom known as the King&#x27;s Breakfast. It&#x27;s the type of excursion that seems doomed from the start, as the King&#x27;s Breakfast is only found in a forest best known for being a place people do not return from, and predictably, things start going off the rails almost immediately. The forest is haunted and seemingly in a constant state of change, there&#x27;s a TERFy lesbian off-grid cult that&#x27;s engaged in some deeply bizarre activities and poor Sarah is… just doing her best (she is painfully relatable).
This book horrified me, made me laugh and made me gag, often all at once. It&#x27;s queer as hell, impressively creepy, packed with extremely on-the-nose satire and an absolutely wild ride all around.</div>
