                <div class="summary">Louis Rosenberg of Unanimous A.I. discusses the challenge of leveraging collective intelligence in large teams, noting that productive real-time conversations typically don&#x27;t scale beyond 4-7 people. He argues that traditional methods like polls and surveys fail to capture the deliberative process necessary for optimal solutions and for individuals to feel heard. Rosenberg advocates for authentic real-time conversations at scale as the best way to unlock the true collective intelligence of large teams, contrasting surveys as treating people as &quot;data points&quot; versus interactive conversations treating them as &quot;thoughtful data processors&quot;. The article&#x27;s title suggests a connection to AI agents enhancing Super Bowl viewer collaboration, implying a potential solution for large-scale team intelligence.</div>

                <div class="summary">Disney has accused ByteDance&#x27;s new generative AI tool, Seedance 2.0, of a &quot;virtual smash-and-grab&quot; by using copyrighted Disney characters from franchises like Star Wars and Marvel without permission to train its AI. According to an Axios report, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter with examples of Seedance videos featuring these characters. This is not Disney&#x27;s first legal action against an AI company, having previously sent cease-and-desist letters to Character.AI and accused Google of copyright infringement. Conversely, Disney has a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI, allowing them to use Disney&#x27;s intellectual property for image and video generation.</div>

                <div class="summary">This is a placeholder summary of the article. Without a doubt, one of the hottest new startup accelerators in tech right now is Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program. Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In a January blog post, the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort. The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on. There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program invests up to $1 million into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors. In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes 7% of the company for $500,000. Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel. Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for the next cohort open in April, though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said. Focus on th...</div>

NanoClaw solves one of OpenClaw&#x27;s biggest security issues — and it&#x27;s already powering the creator&#x27;s biz Carl Franzen February 11, 2026 Credit: VentureBeat made with Google Nano Banana Pro on fal.ai The rapid viral adoption of Austrian developer Peter Steinberger&#x27;s open source AI assistant OpenClaw in recent weeks has sent enterprises and indie developers into a tizzy. It&#x27;s easy to easy why: OpenClaw is freely available now and offers a powerful means of autonomously completing work and performing tasks across a user&#x27;s entire computer, phone, or even business with natural language prompts that spin up swarms of agents. Since its release in November 2025, it&#x27;s captured the market with over 50 modules and broad integrations — but its &quot;permissionless&quot; architecture raised alarms among developers and security teams. Enter NanoClaw , a lighter, more secure version which debuted under an open source MIT License on January 31, 2026, and achieved explosive growth—surpassing 7,000 stars on GitHub in just over a week. Created by Gavriel Cohen—an experienced software engineer who spent seven years at website builder Wix.com—the project was built to address the &quot;security nightmare&quot; inherent in complex, non-sandboxed agent frameworks. Cohen and his brother Lazer are also co-founders of Qwibit , a new AI-first go-to-market agency, and vice president and CEO, respectively, of Concrete Media , a respected public relations firm that often works with tech businesses covered by VentureBeat.

Credit: Concrete Media NanoClaw’s immediate solution to this architectural anxiety is a hard pivot toward operating system-level isolation. The project places every agent inside isolated Linux containers—utilizing Apple Containers for high-performance execution on macOS or Docker for Linux environments. This creates a st...</div>

The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies. The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. For example , the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act. In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter , criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB , claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue ...</div>
