public backlash
against data centers has been intense over the past twelve months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday,
announced what
it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.
Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg
said that
Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to
spend billions to expand its AI capacity
. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.
On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.
“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”
The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers
accused
of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other
environmental concerns
. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering
questions around

In the chaotic world of Large Language Model (LLM) optimization, engineers have spent the last few years developing increasingly esoteric rituals to get better answers.
We’ve seen &quot;Chain of Thought&quot; (asking the model to think step-by-step and often, show those &quot;reasoning traces&quot; to the user), &quot;Emotional Blackmail&quot; (telling the model its career depends on the answer, or that it is
being accused of sexual misconduct
), and complex multi-shot prompting frameworks.
But a new paper released by Google Research suggests that we may have been overthinking it. The researchers found that simply repeating the input query—literally copying and pasting the prompt so it appears twice—consistently improves performance across major models including Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek.
The paper, titled &quot;
Prompt Repetition Improves Non-Reasoning LLMs
,&quot; released last month just before the holidays, presents a finding that is almost suspiciously simple: for tasks that don’t require complex reasoning steps, stating the prompt twice yields significantly better results than stating it once.
Even better, because of how transformer architecture works, this &quot;one weird trick&quot; comes with virtually zero penalty in terms of generation speed.
The Causal Blind Spot
To understand why repeating a question makes a supercomputer smarter, you have to look at the architectural limitations of the standard Transformer model.
Most modern LLMs are trained as &quot;causal&quot; language models. This means they process text strictly from left to right. When the model is processing the 5th token in your sentence, it can &quot;attend&quot; (pay attention) to tokens 1 through 4, but it has zero knowledge of token 6, because it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.

On Tuesday Microsoft
announced
a new initiative called “Community-First AI Infrastructure” that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.
As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been
racing
to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have
profound economic effects
on the surrounding areas in which they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through
heavy power consumption
and by
straining
water supplies due to server cooling needs.
The International Energy Agency (IEA)
projects
that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is
more than
40 years old and under strain.
It’s a big enough issue that in December, US Senators
launched a probe
demanding tech companies explain how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills.

Gigabyte Z890 AORUS motherboard is capable of 256GB DDR5-7200 memory
The motherboard requires two 128GB CQDIMM modules instead of four smaller sticks
Optimized BIOS and motherboard design ensure stability at extreme memory frequencies
Gigabyte has introduced the Z890 AORUS Tachyon ICE CQDIMM Edition motherboard at CES 2026, targeting high-performance consumer applications.
The motherboard relies on two DIMM slots rather than the traditional four, which requires users to install the more expensive 128GB modules to reach a total of 256GB of memory.
The innovation centers on CQDIMM hardware combined with optimized BIOS tuning.

Mike Krieger, the Instagram co-founder who joined Anthropic two years ago as its chief product officer, is moving to a new focus at the AI startup: co-leading its internal incubator, dubbed the “Labs” team.
The Anthropic Labs team started in mid-2024 with just two members; now, the company has decided to expand it, with a focus on building “experimental products.” Krieger’s new title will be simply a member of technical staff reporting to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei, and he’ll co-lead the Labs team with Ben Mann, who has been the company’s product engineering lead. Ami Vora, the company’s current “head of product,” will take over Krieger’s duties and work closely with the company’s chief t...</div>

Proposed legislation opens the door to robotaxi services in New York
Governor Hochul is backing a pilot program to offer commercial self-driving car services in the state.

Waymo, Alphabet&#x27;s self-driving car company,
tested its autonomous vehicles
in New York City in 2025, and as part of proposed legislation from New York Governor Kathy Hochul, the company could soon offer its services across the state,
Wired
reports
.
Governor Hochul&#x27;s proposed legislation was
formally announced
during a State of the State address covering policy proposals for the upcoming year. The new law, if passed, would loosen the state&#x27;s restrictions on self-driving car companies by forming a pilot program that would allow for &quot;the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.&quot; Applicants to the pilot program would need to demonstrate that they have &quot;local support for [autonomous vehicle] deployment&quot; and prove their &quot;adherence to the highest possible safety standards&quot; to be considered.
As a company with presumably good odds of being approved, Waymo supports the legislation. &quot;Governor Hochul’s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York&#x27;s transportation system,&quot; Waymo&#x27;s Head of Global Public Policy Justin Kintz said in a statement. &quot;With the Governor’s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo’s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible.&quot;
Waymo already has commercial robotaxi services in select cities in California, Texas and Georgia, offered on its own or in partnership w...</div>

                <div class="summary">Anthropic has introduced &quot;Cowork,&quot; a new tool designed to make Claude Code more accessible, particularly for non-technical users. Integrated into the Claude Desktop app, Cowork allows users to specify a folder for Claude to interact with files, receiving instructions via a standard chat interface. This creates a sandboxed environment similar to Claude Code but without the need for command-line tools or virtual environments. Currently in research preview and exclusive to Max subscribers, Cowork is inspired by the increasing use of Claude Code for non-coding, agentic AI tasks. It leverages the Claude Agent SDK and offers use cases like assembling expense reports or managing media files. Anthropic emphasizes the importance of clear instructions to mitigate risks such as prompt injection or accidental file deletion, noting that while these risks aren&#x27;t new, Cowork might be the first time many users encounter such advanced agentic AI capabilities.</div>

Elon Musk&#x27;s xAI recently relaxed content guardrails for Grok&#x27;s image generation, leading to an increase in problematic content on X and sexualized images of children, prompting regulatory investigations into xAI. The article highlights Google&#x27;s apparent failure to enforce its own clear content policies, contrasting it with Apple&#x27;s more flexible but often arbitrary approach to app removal. This situation raises questions about Google&#x27;s commitment to its stated guidelines and the implications for user safety and platform integrity.</div>

This decline in MLC capacity, projected to be over 40% year-over-year in 2026, is driven by the increasing dominance of Triple-Level Cell (TLC) and Quad-Level Cell (QLC) technologies in consumer and enterprise storage. The change is fueled by AI&#x27;s growing demand for NAND, pushing the industry towards higher-density, more cost-efficient solutions. While MLC&#x27;s endurance and predictable behavior are still valued in specific sectors, the broader market is embracing TLC and QLC, with Penta-Level Cell (PLC) likely not emerging until the era of petabyte SSDs.</div>
