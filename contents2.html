                <div class="summary">Deepwatch, a cybersecurity firm that makes an AI-powered detection and response platform, laid off dozens of employees on Wednesday, citing AI as one of the reasons.
John DiLullo, CEO at Deepwatch told TechCrunch in an email that the company “is aligning our organization to accelerate our significant investments in AI and automation.”
A current Deepwatch employee, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the press, told TechCrunch that the layoffs affected between 60 and 80 staffers, out of a workforce of around 250 employees. A
post on Linkedin
by a person who said they were laid off mentioned 80 people as well.
“They’re doing something with AI and agentic AI but it sounds like bullshit,” the current employee told TechCrunch.

Eight former Deepwatch employees announced that they were laid off, according to LinkedIn posts seen by TechCrunch.
Deepwatch is not the only cybersecurity company that has conducted layoffs this year. In May, cybersecurity giant
Crowdstrike laid off around 500 workers
, or 5% of its workforce. The cuts came despite a record year with “operating cash flow of $1.38 billion and record full year free cash flow of $1.07 billion,” according to a press release at the time.
Other cybersecurity companies
that have cut their workforce this year are Deep Instinct, Otorio, ActiveFence, SkyBox Security,
and Sophos

Another day in late 2025, another impressive result from a Chinese company in open source artificial intelligence.
Chinese social networking company
Weibo&#x27;s AI division recently released its open source VibeThinker-1.5B
—a 1.5 billion parameter large language model (LLM) that is a fine-tuned variant of rival Chinese tech firm
Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B.
It&#x27;s available now for free download and usage by researchers and enterprise developers—even for commercial purposes—under a permissive MIT License on
Hugging Face
,
GitHub
and
ModelScope
, with a
technical report
on open access science publishing site arxiv.org.
And yet, despite its compact size, VibeThinker-1.5B achieves benchmark-topping reasoning performance on math and code tasks, rivaling or surpassing models hundreds of times its size, even outperforming Chinese rival DeepSeek&#x27;s famed R1 that went viral at the start of this year—a 671-billion parameter model—on formal reasoning benchmark.
It further eclipses Mistral AI&#x27;s Magistral Medium and holds its own against Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4 and OpenAI&#x27;s gpt-oss-20B Medium, all while requiring a fraction of the infrastructure and investment.
It also does so having been post-trained on a budget of merely $7800 USD for compute resources (3900 GPU hours on Nvidia H800s) — far less than the tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of dollars typically required to fine-tune models of similar or larger scale.
Recall this is not the total cost of the model&#x27;s development, however: LLMs are trained in stages. First comes pre-training, when the model learns basic language structure and general knowledge by predicting the next word across enormous amounts of text from the internet, books, and articles.</div>

Alien Earth
will return to FX (and Disney+ and Hulu) for a second season, thanks to a new deal between Disney and series creator Noah Hawley.
The new season has no air date yet, but we do know one thing about it: It will be shot in London. The first season was shot in Thailand, and most of the story took place in Southeast Asia, so the change in shooting location suggests a new setting for much of the next season. Production on season two will
reportedly
begin next year.
For those who watched season one to its conclusion, season two probably seemed like a sure thing; the finale resolved many of the core conflicts of that first batch of episodes, but also was clearly intended to be the launching point for a new storyline in season two.
That instinct is probably right—there was almost likely to be a season two, but the real question was whether Hawley would return as its creative lead. That was contingent on dealmaking between Hawley, FX, and Disney Entertainment Television. That deal has been made, reportedly to the tune of
nine figures.
“I had to plan and execute a story that’s going someplace,” Hawley told
The Hollywood Reporter
regarding
Alien Earth’
s first season. “And then, this whole thing is a proof-of-concept experiment to see if enough people on the planet want to watch an Alien TV show to justify the expense of a second and third season of an Alien TV show. So for me, I never hedged my bets.</div>

The breach involved Remote Access Trojans capable of attacking global operating systems
Researchers found 95GB of immigration data stolen from India’s national databases
A recent data breach at Chinese security firm Knownsec has revealed over 12,000 classified files tied to state-owned cyber operations.
The leaked materials reportedly include details on “cyber weapons,” internal
AI tools
, and an extensive list of international targets.
The incident has not only exposed technical data but also shown how deeply a private company can be embedded in national cyber programs.

Despite swift takedown efforts on GitHub, where some files briefly appeared, the contents have already circulated among researchers and intelligence analysts.
The documents appear to offer a rare look into China’s cyber ecosystem, showing links between Knownsec and various government departments.
The leaked files outline a number of global targets, naming over twenty countries and regions, including Japan, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the UK.
Among the most concerning revelations are spreadsheets that reportedly detail attacks on 80 foreign targets, including critical infrastructure and telecommunications companies.</div>

When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doomscrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.</div>

JISULIFE
Jisulife Life7 Handheld Fan
This is one of the most useful gadgets I purchased this year, and it’ll make a great gift for anyone regardless of the climate they live in. It’s a powerful
handheld fan
that can also be worn around the neck, or folded to sit on a desk or table, keeping you cool hands-free. It has five different speed settings and a nifty little display in the middle of the fan that shows how much battery life is left. All summer, this fan never left my bag and saved me many times from the sweltering heat of New York City, and made things a bit more bearable during multi-hour outdoor events.</div>

                <div class="summary">Masayoshi Son isn’t known for half measures. The SoftBank founder’s career has been studded with eyebrow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last.
His latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake to go all-in on AI. And while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it’s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn’t push his chips to the center of the table.
Consider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son’s net worth soared to about $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally – which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history — as SoftBank’s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion.
Amid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth
$150 billion
by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry’s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.
That Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn’t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley.
After journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as “horrific and deeply regrettable” but insisted SoftBank couldn’t “turn our backs on the Saudi people,” maintaining the firm’s commitment to managing the kingdom’s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.
That didn’t turn out so well.</div>

Senior software developers are preparing for a major shift in how they work as artificial intelligence becomes central to their workflows, according to
BairesDev’s
latest
Dev Barometer
report publishing tomorrow. VentureBeat was given an exclusive early look and the findings below come directly from that report.
The quarterly global survey, which polled 501 developers and 19 project managers across 92 software initiatives, finds that nearly two-thirds (65%) of senior developers expect their roles to be redefined by AI in 2026.
The data highlights a transformation underway in software development: fewer routine coding tasks, more emphasis on design and strategy, and a rising need for AI fluency.
From Coders to Strategists
Among those anticipating change, 74% say they expect to shift from hands-on coding to designing solutions.
Another 61% plan to integrate AI-generated code into their workflows, and half foresee spending more time on system strategy and architecture.
“It’s not about lines of code anymore,” said Justice Erolin, Chief Technology Officer at BairesDev, in a recent interview with
VentureBeat
conducted over video call. “It’s about the quality and type of code, and the kind of work developers are doing.”
Erolin said the company is watching developers evolve from individual contributors into system thinkers.
“AI is great at code scaffolding and generating unit tests, saving developers around eight hours a week,” he explained. “That time can now be used for solution architecture and strategy work—areas where AI still falls short.”
The survey’s data reflects this shift. Developers are moving toward higher-value tasks while automation takes over much of the repetitive coding that once occupied junior engineers.</div>

A Reddit moderator known as “KlammereFyr” was recently
convicted
by a Danish court after clipping and posting hundreds of nude scenes that actresses filmed for movies and TV shows but apparently never expected to be shared out of context.
As TorrentFreak
reported
, dozens of actresses had complained about the mod’s sub-reddit, “SeDetForPlottet” (WatchItForthePlot), with some feeling “molested or abused.”
Demanding Danish police put an end to the forum, the Rights Alliance—representing the Danish Actors’ Association, two broadcasters, and other rightsholders—pushed for a criminal probe.
The groups argued that KlammereFyr removed the artistic context and immorally sexualized actors, sometimes by cropping scenes or “changing the lighting to accentuate certain features,” TorrentFreak reported.
To groups, it seemed clear that KlammereFyr was violating a rarely tested part of copyright law that protects artists’ “integrity” by shielding their “moral rights.”
In Denmark, the “right of integrity means that even in cases where you are allowed to make use of a work, you are not allowed to change it or use it in a way or in a context that infringes the author’s literary or artistic reputation or uniqueness,” a
resource
for Danish researchers noted.
Ultimately, a now 40-year-old man was charged after confessing to violating moral rights by sharing at least 347 clips featuring over 100 actresses that a Danish outlet reported were viewed 4.2 million times.</div>

Microsoft finds Whisper Leak shows privacy flaws inside encrypted AI systems
Encrypted AI chats may still leak clues about what users discuss
Attackers can track conversation topics using packet size and timing
Microsoft
has revealed a new type of cyberattack it has called &quot;Whisper Leak&quot;, which is able to expose the topics users discuss with AI chatbots, even when conversations are fully encrypted.
The company’s
research
suggests attackers can study the size and timing of encrypted packets exchanged between a user and a large language model to infer what is being discussed.
&quot;If a government agency or internet service provider were monitoring traffic to a popular AI
chatbot
, they could reliably identify users asking questions about specific sensitive topics,&quot; Microsoft said.

Whisper Leak attacks
This means &quot;encrypted&quot; doesn’t necessarily mean invisible - with the vulnerability lies in how
LLMs
send responses.
These models do not wait for a complete reply, but transmit data incrementally, creating small patterns that attackers can analyze.
Over time, as they collect more samples, these patterns become clearer, allowing more accurate guesses about the nature of conversations.
This technique doesn’t decrypt messages directly but exposes enough metadata to make educated inferences, which is arguably just as concerning.</div>
