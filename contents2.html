                <div class="summary">SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket lifted off on its tenth test flight Tuesday evening, hitting two long sought milestones and putting an end to a string of failures.
The 403-foot vehicle lifted off from Starbase, SpaceX’s launch facility and recently incorporated city, at 7:30 pm ET after two scrubs earlier in this week. The rocket ascended on 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines before separating around three minutes after liftoff.
On descent, the Super Heavy booster tested out a new maneuver: intentionally shutting down the engines used for landing and transitioning to backup engines. The test will help engineers understand how the Booster might perform in the case of failure. The test appeared to go as planned, with the 232-foot-tall booster successfully making a targeted splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, the upper stage, also called Starship, reached space. There, for the first time on a Starship flight, it opened its Pez-style payload door and released eight Starlink mass-simular satellites. This is a capability that SpaceX had planned, but failed to demonstrate on earlier missions. The company also successfully re-lit one of the Raptor engines in space before guiding the vehicle toward the Indian Ocean, where it splashed down, tipped over, and promptly exploded.
On the way down, the exterior of the Ship was exposed to incredible heat during atmospheric reentry, providing an excellent test environment for the upgraded thermal-protection system. SpaceX also used this test to try out a series of experiments, like removing tiles from sections of the Ship to see how its “skin” operates on reentry, plus a new metallic tile and an actively cooled tile.
Most importantly, however, is the upper stage completed the entire test and splashed down in the Indian Ocean without losing comms with SpaceX engineers. Durin the last flight, the Ship reached space and then lost attitude control during the coast phase, preventing the payload doors from opening.</div>

A new technique from
Zhejiang University
and
Alibaba Group
gives large language model (LLM) agents a dynamic memory, making them more efficient and effective at complex tasks. The technique, called
Memp
, provides agents with a “procedural memory” that is continuously updated as they gain experience, much like how humans learn from practice.
Memp creates a lifelong learning framework where agents don’t have to start from scratch for every new task. Instead, they become progressively better and more efficient as they encounter new situations in real-world environments, a key requirement for reliable enterprise automation.
The case for procedural memory in AI agents
LLM agents hold promise for automating complex, multi-step business processes. In practice, though, these long-horizon tasks can be fragile. The researchers point out that unpredictable events like network glitches, user interface changes or shifting data schemas can derail the entire process. For current agents, this often means starting over every time, which can be time-consuming and costly.
Meanwhile, many complex tasks, despite surface differences, share deep structural commonalities. Instead of relearning these patterns every time, an agent should be able to extract and reuse its experience from past successes and failures, the researchers point out. This requires a specific “procedural memory,” which in humans is the long-term memory responsible for skills like typing or riding a bike, that become automatic with practice.

Authors are celebrating a &quot;historic&quot; settlement expected to be reached soon in a
class-action lawsuit over Anthropic&#x27;s AI training data
.
On Tuesday, US District Judge William Alsup confirmed that Anthropic and the authors &quot;believe they have a settlement in principle&quot; and will file a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by September 5.
The settlement announcement comes after Alsup certified what
AI industry advocates criticized
as the largest copyright class action of all time. Although the lawsuit was raised by three authors—Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber—Alsup allowed up to 7 million claimants to join based on the large number of books that Anthropic may have illegally downloaded to train its AI models.
If every author in the class filed a claim, industry advocates warned, it would &quot;financially ruin&quot; the entire AI industry.
It&#x27;s unclear if the class certification prompted the settlement or what terms authors agreed to, but according to court filings, the settlement terms are binding. A lawyer representing authors,
Justin A. Nelson, told Ars that more details would be revealed soon, and he confirmed that the suing authors are claiming a win for possibly millions of class members.
&quot;This historic settlement will benefit all class members,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;We look forward to announcing details of the settlement in the coming weeks.</div>

High-frequency signals collapse when walls or people block their path
Neural networks learned beam bending by simulating countless basketball practice shots
Metasurfaces integrated into transmitters shaped signals with extreme precision
For years, researchers have struggled with some
vulnerabilities
in ultrahigh-frequency communications.
Ultrahigh frequencies are so fragile that signals that promise immense bandwidth can collapse when confronted with even modest obstacles, as walls, bookcases, or simply moving people can bring cutting-edge transmissions to a halt.
However, a new approach from Princeton engineers suggests those barriers may not be permanent roadblocks, although the leap from experiment to real-world deployment still remains uncertain.

Microsoft president Brad Smith hosted an impromptu press conference on Tuesday afternoon, just hours after protesters gained access to a building at the company’s headquarters and
held a sit-in demonstration inside his office
.
Seated on the edge of his desk, in the office that had been occupied by protesters earlier that day, Smith addressed a group of reporters and viewers on a live stream. “Obviously, this was an unusual day,” he said, the camera shaking as he spoke.</div>

Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday, broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who&#x27;s covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget.
Please enjoy — and I&#x27;ll see you next week.
The climbing genre is not a monolith — that is to say, there’s plenty of variation in the realm of mountaineering games, from mechanically driven cliff-scaling sims to silly multiplayer survival experiences, but they tend to share the same premise: Reach the peak. You’re miles from civilization, with no vehicles and a limited backpack of equipment, and directly in front of you, there’s a mountain. Ascend.

All you have is your body and mental fortitude against an overwhelming physical challenge, and your step-by-step journey is the story. There’s an obvious symbolism to these games, offering a cliff face as the physical manifestation of impossibility, hopelessness, oppression or fear, alongside a surface-level message about never giving up, trying again and generally hanging in there. Cat poster vibes, but an ever-relevant and poignant lesson nonetheless.
Today, though — particularly after spending time playing the
Cairn
and
Baby Steps
demos, and watching
PEAK
streams — I want to focus on the other half of the climbing-game equation. The part where you fall, over and over and over again.</div>

                <div class="summary">This is a summary of the article. The original article discusses Months before a jury awarded a $242.5 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash, the automaker had a chance to settle for $60 million. Instead, Tesla rejected that offer, according to new legal filings that were first
reported by Reuters
.
The settlement proposal, which was made in May, was disclosed in a filing that requested Tesla cover legal fees for the plaintiffs in the case.
Earlier this month, a jury in federal court in Miami found Tesla
partly to blame
for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system. One person was killed when a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged plowed through an intersection and hit a Chevrolet Tahoe. The crash victims, Neima Benavides Leon and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, were standing outside the vehicle on the shoulder at the time. Leon was killed while Angulo was severely injured.
The driver, who was not a defendant in this case, was sued separately for his responsibility. The lawsuit filed in 2021 against Tesla centered on Autopilot, which was engaged but did not brake in time to avoid going through the intersection. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame and attributed one-third to Tesla. As part of the verdict, the jury awarded the $242.5 million verdict as part of its decision.
Tesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch earlier this month, said it plans to appeal the verdict “given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.”
TechCrunch has reached out to the plaintiffs’ attorneys as well as Tesla. An outside PR firm that previously provided statements on Tesla’s behalf declined to comment and directed TechCrunch to the company’s press address. Tesla disbanded its communications team several years ago.
The lawsuit, case 1:21-cv-21940-BB, was filed in 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Android&#x27;s open nature set it apart from the iPhone as the era of touchscreen smartphones began nearly two decades ago. Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to
verify developer identities no matter where they offer their content
, and apps without verification won&#x27;t work on most Android devices in the coming years.
Google used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform&#x27;s reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is
still not perfect
, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.
This, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google&#x27;s new developer verification system. The company describes it like an &quot;ID check at the airport.&quot; Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. ...</div>
