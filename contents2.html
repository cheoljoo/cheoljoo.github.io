Taryn Plumb

Today’s LLMs excel at reasoning, but can still struggle with context. This is particularly true in real-time ordering systems like
Instacart
. Instacart CTO Anirban Kundu calls it the &quot;brownie recipe problem.&quot;
It&#x27;s not as simple as telling an LLM ‘I want to make brownies.’ To be truly assistive when planning the meal, the model must go beyond that simple directive to understand what’s available in the user’s market based on their preferences — say, organic eggs versus regular eggs — and factor that into what’s deliverable in their geography so food doesn’t spoil. This among other critical factors. For Instacart, the challenge is juggling latency with the right mix of context to provide experiences in, ideally, less than one second’s time. “If reasoning itself takes 15 seconds, and if every interaction is that slow, you&#x27;re gonna lose the user,” Kundu said at a recent VB event. Mixing reasoning, real-world state, personalization
In grocery delivery, there’s a “world of reasoning” and a “world of state” (what’s available in the real world),
Kundu
noted, both of which must be understood by an LLM along with user preference. But it’s not as simple as loading the entirety of a user’s purchase history and known interests into a reasoning model. “Your LLM is gonna blow up into a size that will be unmanageable,” said Kundu. To get around this, Instacart splits processing into chunks. First, data is fed into a large foundational model that can understand intent and categorize products. That processed data is then routed to
small language models (SLMs)
designed for catalog context (the types of food or other items that work together) and semantic understanding. In the case of catalog context, the SLM must be able to process mu...</div>

Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health under the Trump administration, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Tuesday. In the wide-ranging hearing, Bhattacharya defended the chaotic and disruptive cuts at the institutes he helms while carefully wording responses related to vaccines—seemingly to avoid contradicting his boss, anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As Bhattacharya testified, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the HELP committee’s ranking member, released a
report
outlining
the state of the NIH
. The report concluded that the Trump administration is “failing American patients,” and “destroying medical research through cuts to research grants, terminations of clinical trials, and the chaos it has created.”
Since Trump took office, the NIH has terminated or frozen hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, the report found.</div>

Back when artificial intelligence was still poorly understood outside research labs,
Ray Kurzweil
was already frustrated with how narrowly it was being discussed. In a 1991 interview with
Computerworld
, he pushed back forcefully against claims that AI had failed to live up to its promise. “That’s unfair, because every time we master a particular area of AI, it ceases to be considered AI. It’s just like a magic trick — when you know how it’s done, it’s no longer magic,” he
said
, adding, “Take machine vision, for example, which today [in 1991] is a $300 million business. People don’t consider that AI, but it is part of AI.”
Kurzweil argued that public expectations were skewed not by failure, but by familiarity.</div>

Digital frames FAQs
A digital photo frame shouldn’t be complicated. At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week. That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country.</div>

YC startups can now receive investment in stablecoin
All startups accepted into YC will soon have the option to receive their seed checks via stablecoins, crypto YC partner Nemil Dalal
told The Block. YC’s famous
“standard deal”
is that it invests $500,000 into startups accepted into its program in exchange for 7% of their companies. Now that deal is hitting the blockchain (Base, Solana, and Ethereum, to be exact), starting with the upcoming spring batch. Dalal said that stablecoin transfers are often more effective, specifically for founders working in emerging markets. But also, YC is putting its money where its mouth is, so to speak. Last fall, YC
partnered with
Base and Coinbase Ventures to encourage founders to build more blockchain
-related companies. Interest in blockchain tech is on the rise again in Silicon Valley as the U.S. has taken steps toward
more formal, crypto-friendly regulation of the industry. Topics

                <div class="summary">SOC teams are automating triage — but 40% will fail without governance boundaries
Louis Columbus
January 27, 2026
The average enterprise SOC receives 10,000 alerts per day. Each requires
20 to 40 minutes
to investigate properly, but even fully staffed teams can only handle 22% of them. More than
60% of security teams have admitted to ignoring alerts
that later proved critical. Running an efficient SOC has never been harder, and now the work itself is changing. Tier-1 analyst tasks — like triage, enrichment, and escalation — are becoming software functions, and more SOC teams are turning to supervised AI agents to handle the volume. Human analysts are shifting their priorities to investigate, review, and make edge-case decisions. Response times are being reduced. Not integrating human insight and intuition comes with a high cost, however. Gartner predicts
over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled
by the end of 2027, with the main drivers being unclear business value and inadequate governance. Getting change management right and making sure generative AI doesn’t become a
chaos agent
in the SOC are even more important. Why the legacy SOC model needs to change
Burnout is so severe in many SOCs today that
senior analysts are considering career changes
. Legacy SOCs that have multiple systems that deliver conflicting alerts, and the many systems that can’t talk to each other at all, are making the job a recipe for burnout, and the talent pipeline cannot refill faster than burnout empties it. CrowdStrike&#x27;s 2025 Global Threat Report documents
breakout times as fast as 51 seconds
and found 79% of intrusions are now malware-free. Attackers rely on identity abuse, credential theft, and living-off-the-land techniques instead. Manual triage built for hourly response cycles cannot compete. As Matthew Sharp, CISO at Xactly,
told CSO Online

Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for
Animal Crossing
) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2. The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (
PDF
). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo
introduced in August of 2025
, citing “market conditions.”
That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became
the third-bestselling game console of all time
. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life.</div>

If you&#x27;re looking for a portable second screen that does justice to your laptop or monitor, then you&#x27;ll definitely want to check out
Arzopa&#x27;s 16.1-inch portable monitor, now $140 (was $200) at Amazon
. Beyond the boosted screen space, specs are great here, with a 2.5K resolution for extra detail you don&#x27;t always get on similarly sized portable displays. And when it comes to balancing price and performance, Arzopa makes some of the
best portable monitors
we&#x27;ve tested for both work and play. I can&#x27;t recommend getting a second screen enough. A portable monitor can be a seriously useful, low-cost upgrade if you work on a laptop, travel frequently, or just want more screen space without committing to a full desk setup. Adding a second display makes it easier to keep reference material open, manage e...</div>
