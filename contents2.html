                <div class="summary">In the wake of TikTok’s U.S. ownership change last week, some users are seeking out
alternative
platforms. One app gaining traction is
UpScrolled
, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.
Upscrolled
blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages.
The app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the
app’s website
. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”
“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi says in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”
The app, available on both
iOS
and
Android
, is grappling with a surge of new users, but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand.
According to data from the market intelligence provider
Appfigures
, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads.

Claude Code&#x27;s &#x27;Tasks&#x27; update lets agents work longer and coordinate across sessions

One of the biggest constraints currently facing AI builders who want to deploy agents in service of their individual or enterprise goals is the &quot;working memory&quot; required to manage complex, multi-stage engineering projects.
Typically, when a AI agent operates purely on a stream of text or voice-based conversation, it lacks the structural permanence to handle dependencies. It knows what to do, but it often forgets why it is doing it, or in what order.
With the release of
Tasks for Claude Code (introduced in v2.1.16) last week
, Anthropic has introduced a solution that is less about &quot;AI magic&quot; and more about sound software engineering principles.
By moving from ephemeral &quot;To-dos&quot; to persistent &quot;Tasks,&quot; the company is fundamentally re-architecting how the model interacts with time, complexity, and system resources.
This update transforms the tool from a reactive coding assistant into a state-aware project manager, creating the infrastructure necessary to execute the sophisticated workflows outlined in Anthropic&#x27;s just-released Best Practices guide, while recent
changelog updates (v2.1.19)
signal a focus on the stability required for enterprise adoption.
The architecture of agency: from ephemeral to persistent
To understand the significance of this release for engineering teams, we must look at the mechanical differences between the old &quot;To-do&quot; system and the new &quot;Task&quot; primitive.
Previously, Claude Code utilized a &quot;To-do&quot; list—a lightweight, chat-resident checklist.

In early 2025, Forbes
reports
, investigators at the FBI served Microsoft with a warrant seeking the BitLocker encryption recovery keys for several laptops it believed held evidence of fraud in Guam’s COVID-19 unemployment assistance program. And Microsoft complied with the FBI’s request.
BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually,
during the Windows 8 era
Microsoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft’s servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don’t lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too.
A Microsoft rep said that the company handled “around 20” similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these requests often fail because users haven’t stored their recovery keys on Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft an...</div>

Rugged mobile NAS combines touchscreen control storage and battery backup
UnifyDrive UP6 targets photographers needing fast local media transfers
Integrated UPS and offline mode support field based file work
A rugged mobile NAS with an integrated tablet-style interface has finally gone on sale after first
being announced a year ago at CES 2025
.
At $1,599, the UnifyDrive UP6 isn’t cheap, but it combines portable flash storage, networking, battery backup, and on-device processing in a single unit.
Compact and weighing about 1300g without its protective case, UP6 is primarily aimed at photographers and video creators who need fast local file backup and file management when out and about.

Ubisoft proposes even more layoffs after last week&#x27;s studio closures and game cancellations
It plans to let up to 200 people go from its Paris headquarters.

It looks like Ubisoft is planning even more layoffs to accompany last week&#x27;s studio closures and game cancellations,
according to reporting by
IGN
. The company is planning a massive reduction of the workforce in its Paris headquarters. It has proposed the loss of up to 200 jobs, which is nearly 20 percent of the current staff.
This will be organized under France&#x27;s
Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process
, in which staff can agree to form a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement. It&#x27;s not a done deal just yet, with a company spokesperson saying &quot;at this stage, this remains a proposal and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached.&quot;
The RCC process is voluntary, which is good for Ubisoft Paris employees, but the company hasn&#x27;t made any statement regarding what it would do if it doesn&#x27;t get 200 willing participants. The company recently
introduced a mandate
for employees to return to the office for five days each week, which could entice staffers with one foot out the door.

This is just the latest cost-cutting measure by Ubisoft, as the company has been
experiencing difficulties for months
. It shut down its Halifax studio
just 16 days after
employees entered into a unionization agreement. Last week, it shuttered its Stockholm studio and announced
various restructuring efforts
at several other developers under its umbrella.
It also announced the cancellation of six games, including the long-awaited
Prince of Persia: San...</div>

A quick bit of breaking news that hit just as we were about to send this newsletter out. The
National Transportation Safety Board
has opened an investigation into
Waymo
after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.

.
Now onto our regular programming …
Tesla
made a couple of moves this week — and just before its quarterly earnings drops — designed to show its progress, and even dominance, in automated driving technology. But, hold up, there is more to it than mere optics.
The week started with Tesla offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin
without a human safety driver
in the front seat. If you recall, Tesla launched a limited service in Austin last year with a fleet of modified Tesla Model Y vehicles running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software known as Full Self-Driving Supervised (this one being “unsupervised”). Human safety operators have been riding in the front passenger seat as a precaution since the rollout.
Not all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless, and there is apparently a chase vehicle behind those that are. Still, it is notable and suggests Tesla is moving toward a broader ramp-up.
Meanwhile,
Tesla has killed Autopilot
, the advanced driver-assistance system that was initially introduced to its vehicles in 2014. Autopilot has gone through several software and hardware iterations over the years with new capabilities.

Conversational AI doesn’t understand users — &#x27;Intent First&#x27; architecture does
Sreenivasa Reddy Hulebeedu Reddy

The modern customer has just one need that matters: Getting
the thing
they want
when they want it
. The old standard RAG model
embed+retrieve+LLM
misunderstands intent, overloads context and misses freshness, repeatedly sending customers down the wrong paths.
Instead, intent-first architecture uses a lightweight language model to parse the query for intent and context, before delivering to the most relevant content sources (documents, APIs, people).
Enterprise AI is a speeding train headed for a cliff. Organizations are deploying LLM-powered search applications at a record pace, while a fundamental architectural issue is setting most up for failure.
A recent Coveo study revealed that
72% of enterprise search queries fail
to deliver meaningful results on the first attempt, while Gartner also predicts that the majority of conversational AI deployments have been falling short of enterprise expectations.
The problem isn’t the underlying models. It’s the architecture around them.
After designing and running live AI-driven customer interaction platforms at scale, serving millions of customer and citizen users at some of the world’s largest telecommunications and healthcare organizations, I’ve come to see a pattern. It’s the difference between successful
AI-powered interaction deployments
and multi-million-dollar failures.
It’s a cloud-native
architecture
pattern that I call
Intent-First
. And it’s reshaping the way enterprises build AI-powered experiences.
The $36 pillion problem
Gartner projects the global conversational AI market will balloon to
$36 billion by 2032
. Enterprises are scrambling to get a slice. The demos are irresistible. Plug your
LLM into your knowledge base
, and suddenly it can answer customer questions in natural language.Magic.
Then production happens.

A decade is a long time for a TV series; no single iteration of
Star Trek
has made it that far.
But “a
Star Trek
podcast by two guys just a little bit embarrassed to have a
Star Trek
podcast” has now passed the milestone. January 25, 2026, marks a full decade since
The Greatest Generation
, my favorite podcast, debuted. Like a bottle of Château Picard, the show
has only improved with age. (I
interviewed the guys behind the show
back in 2016 when they were just getting started.)
The podcast helped me rediscover, and appreciate more fully,
Star Trek: The Next Generation—
which is also my favorite TV show.
The Greatest Generation
continues to delight with its irreverent humor, its celebration of the most minor of characters, and its technical fascination with how a given episode was made.
Over the last decade, hosts Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica have both moved to Los Angeles and become full-time podcasters. They have completed an episode-by-episode recap of all of
The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine,
and
Voyager
, and they’re now nearing the end of
Enterprise.
When finished, they’re threatening/promising to start over again.
The podcast has spawned its own (sometimes NSFW!) lexicon (a “friend of DeSoto” means a listener to and fan of
The Greatest Generation
), its own recurring and hilarious segments (“Drunk Shimoda,” “Bad Bit Moment,” and “Polo? Polo? Or Pollo?”), and most importantly, its own delightful fandom. It’s the coolest and dorkiest secret club that I will ever be a part of.
In 2016, the podcast was folded into the
Maximum Fun
organization. Harrison and Pranica formed their own company, Uxbridge-Shimoda...</div>

Robots still fail quickly once removed from predictable factory environments
Microsoft Rho-alpha links language understanding directly to robotic motion control
Tactile sensing is central to narrowing gaps between software and physical action
Robots have long performed reliably inside tightly controlled industrial settings with predictable environments and limited deviations, but outside of that, they often struggle.
To alleviate this issue,
Microsoft
has announced
Rho-alpha
, the first robotics model derived from its Phi vision-language series, arguing robots need better ways to see and understand instructions
The company believes systems can operate beyond assembly lines by responding to changing conditions rather than following rigid scripts.

It’s not surprising when the guy who’s been yelling about the horrors of late-stage capitalism on Instagram for the last five years turns his ire towards ICE. But something different has been happening over the week or so, following the most recent shootings of civilians by federal agents — even accounts that stay laser focused on
golfing
, chopping wood, and playing cats like bongos have started to speak out.
The tenor on social media and Reddit took an even sharper turn yesterday, following the
killing of Alex Pretti
by ICE. Even the moderator of normally politics-free r/catbongos (a subreddit “Where gentlemen, gentlewomen, and gentlethems of quality gather to watch cats being played like bongos”) spokeout in a
post
where they declared that “If you still support Trump/ICE even slightly, you’re not welcome in this sub.”
