OpenAI reportedly developing new generative music tool
OpenAI is working on a new tool that would generate music based on text and audio prompts, according to
a report in The Information
.
Such a tool could be used to add music to existing videos, or to add guitar accompaniment to an existing vocal track, sources said. It’s not clear when OpenAI plans to launch such a tool or whether it would be available as a standalone product (as opposed to integrating with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and
video app Sora
).
One source told The Information that OpenAI is working with some students from the Juilliard School to annotate scores as a way to provide training data.
While OpenAI has launched generative music models in the past, they predate the launch of ChatGPT; more recently, the company has been
developing audio models
focused on text-to-speech and speech-to-text. Other companies with generative music models include Google and Suno.
TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.

While the world&#x27;s leading artificial intelligence companies race to build ever-larger models, betting billions that scale alone will unlock artificial general intelligence, a researcher at one of the industry&#x27;s most secretive and valuable startups delivered a pointed challenge to that orthodoxy this week: The path forward isn&#x27;t about training bigger — it&#x27;s about learning better.
&quot;I believe that the first superintelligence will be a superhuman learner,&quot;
Rafael Rafailov
, a reinforcement learning researcher at
Thinking Machines Lab
, told an audience at TED AI San Francisco on Tuesday. &quot;It will be able to very efficiently figure out and adapt, propose its own theories, propose experiments, use the environment to verify that, get information, and iterate that process.&quot;
This breaks sharply with the approach pursued by
OpenAI
,
Anthropic
,
Google DeepMind
, and other leading laboratories, which have bet billions on scaling up model size, data, and compute to achieve increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Rafailov argues these companies have the strategy backwards: what&#x27;s missing from today&#x27;s most advanced AI systems isn&#x27;t more scale — it&#x27;s the ability to actually learn from experience.
&quot;Learning is something an intelligent being does,&quot; Rafailov said, citing a quote he described as recently compelling. &quot;Training is something that&#x27;s being done to it.&quot;
The distinction cuts to the core of how AI systems improve — and whether the industry&#x27;s current trajectory can deliver on its most ambitious promises. Rafailov&#x27;s comments offer a rare window into the thinking at
Thinking Machines Lab
, the startup co-founded in February by former OpenAI chief technology officer
Mira Murati
that raised a record-breaking
$2 billion in seed funding
at a $12 billion valuation.</div>

For millennia, some of the world’s largest filter-feeding whales, including humpbacks, fin whales, and blue whales, have undertaken some of the
longest migrations
on earth to travel between their warm breeding grounds in the tropics to nutrient-rich feeding destinations in the poles each year.
“Nature has finely tuned these journeys, guided by memory and environmental cues that tell whales when to move and where to go,” said Trisha Atwood, an ecologist and associate professor at Utah State University’s Quinney College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. But, she said, climate change is “scrambling these signals,” forcing the marine mammals to veer off course. And they’re not alone.
Earlier this year, Atwood joined more than 70 other scientists to discuss the global impacts of climate change on migratory species in a workshop convened by the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The organization monitors and protects more than 1,000 species that cross borders in search of food, mates, and favorable conditions to nurture their offspring.
More than 20 percent of these species are on the brink of extinction. It was the first time the convention had gathered for such a purpose, and their findings,
published this month in a report,
were alarming.
“Almost no migratory species is untouched by climate change,” Atwood said in an email to Inside Climate News.</div>

Want a big saving on one of the most premium hair dryers you can buy? Now you can, as the
Dyson Supersonic Origin Hair Dryer is at Amazon for $299.99 (was $419.99)
.
The
Dyson
Supersonic Origin is the slightly cheaper version of the Dyson Supersonic. The only difference between the two is that the Supersonic Origin comes with the styling concentrator attachment only, whereas the original Supersonic comes with five attachments for different hair types. These two models only differ by $30 at full price, but the fact that the Origin is on sale at last year&#x27;s Black Friday price makes it worth a look.
Today&#x27;s best Dyson Supersonic deal
Dyson  Supersonic Origin Hair Dryer :
was $419.99
now $299.99
at Amazon
The Dyson Supersonic Origin Hair Dryer is basically the same as the original Dyson Supersonic, just with the styling concentrator attachment only instead of the full set. That styling concentrator attachment makes it easier to recreate a salon-like &quot;blow out&quot; style on your own hair at home, which works great for folks with the right hair type to pull it off. At the Supersonic Origin&#x27;s Black Friday price, there&#x27;s no better offer if you want to buy ahead of the holiday season.

Various other Dyson Supersonic models are included in our guide to the
best hair dryers
, including the Dyson Supersonic Nural and Dyson Supersonic r. They can handle hair more delicately than cheaper brands thanks to features that prevent hair damage and make styling easier.
The Dyson Supersonic Origin is no different.</div>

Tech left teens fighting over scraps, and now it wants those too
They’ve been pushed out of the workforce, now we’re training robots to do the few jobs teens have left.

Right now, there are
robots stocking convenience store shelves
in Japan. We haven’t embraced that tech here in America yet, but it’s hard to imagine 7-11 or Walmart won’t at least experiment with it soon. Walmart gave up on its
shelf-scanning robots
in 2020, but machine vision and AI have improved a lot in the last five years, and it’s only a matter of time before it’s a machine refilling that row of family-sized Fruity Pebbles and not a kid earning some extra cash during senior year of high school.
Truth is, there just aren’t many jobs for teens out there anymore, and most of them have chosen to simply remove themselves from the job market. In August of 2000, 52.</div>

Dodgers vs. Blue Jays, Game 2 tonight: How to watch the 2025 MLB World Series without cable
The League Championship Series are history, and the final two teams have emerged: The 2025 Fall Classic will see the
Los Angeles Dodgers face the Toronto Blue Jays
. Game 2 of the 2025 MLB World Series begins tonight — Saturday, Oct. 25 — at 8PM ET/5PM PT, with the Blue Jays getting the initial home field advantage at
Rogers Centre, Toronto
for the second night in a row.
Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers
are aiming to win their second consecutive championship, while Vlad Guerrero Jr. and the Blue Jays are eyeing their first ring since 1993. Despite Toronto&#x27;s victory over Los Angeles last night, the World Series
odds still favor the Dodgers
ahead of Game 2. Every 2025 MLB World Series game will air on Fox and Fox Deportes.
Of course, Fox is a &quot;free&quot; over-the-air channel, so any affordable
digital antenna
will pull in the game if you live close enough to a local affiliate. But if that&#x27;s not an option, here&#x27;s a full rundown of how to watch the Dodgers vs. Blue Jays World Series, even without cable.
How to watch the L.A. Dodgers vs. Toronto Blue Jays, Game 2
You can stream Fox on any
live TV streaming service
that airs Fox local stations, including DirecTV, Fubo and Hulu + Live TV. MLB World Series games will also be available on Fox&#x27;s new streaming platform,

The next big trend in AI providers appears to be &quot;studio&quot; environments on the web that allow users to spin up agents and AI applications within minutes.
Case in point, today the well-funded French AI startup
Mistral launched its own Mistral AI Studio
, a new production platform designed to help enterprises build, observe, and operationalize AI applications at scale atop Mistral&#x27;s growing family of proprietary and open source large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.
It&#x27;s an evolution of its legacy API and AI building platorm, &quot;
Le Platforme
,&quot; initially launched in late 2023, and that brand name is being retired for now.

The move comes just days after U.S. rival
Google updated its AI Studio,
also launched in late 2023, to be easier for non-developers to use and build and deploy apps with natural language, aka &quot;vibe coding.&quot;
But while Google&#x27;s update appears to target novices who want to tinker around, Mistral appears more fully focused on building an easy-to-use enterprise AI app development and launchpad, which may require some technical knowledge or familiarity with LLMs, but far less than that of a seasoned developer.
In other words, those outside the tech team at your enterprise could potentially use this to build and test simple apps, tools, and workflows — all powered by E.U.-native AI models operating on E.U.-based infrastructure.
That may be a welcome change for companies concerned about the political situation in the U.S., or who have large operations in Europe and prefer to give their business to homegrown alternatives to U.S. and Chines...</div>

Yesterday, Donald Trump
announced on social media
that he had been planning to “surge” troops into San Francisco this weekend—but was dissuaded from doing so by several tech billionaires.
“Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump wrote.
Who are these “friends”? Trump named “great people like [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang, [Salesforce CEO] Marc Benioff, and others” who told him that “the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!”
Ludicrously wealthy tech execs have exerted unparalleled sway over Trump in the last year. Not content with obsequious flattery—at one
recent White House dinner
, Sam Altman called Trump “a pro-business, pro-innovation president” who was “a very refreshing change,” while Tim Cook praised the legendarily mercurial Trump’s “focus and your leadership”—tech leaders have also
given Trump shiny awards
,
built him a bulletproof ballroom
, and
donated massive sums
to help him get elected.
Most of these execs also have major business before the federal government and have specific “asks” around AI regulation, crypto, tariffs, regulations, and government contracts.
Now, tech execs are even helping to shape the militarization of American cities.
Consider Benioff, for instance. On October 10, he
gave an interview to The New York Times
in which he spoke to a reporter ...</div>

                <div class="summary">TechRadar Verdict
It may not hit every note perfectly, but Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is an honest, heavy, and deeply human look at Bruce Springsteen during arguably one of his darkest periods, one that still showcases the music-making process with just a taste of E Street Band greatness. Ultimately, an antithesis of most biopics, and that&#x27;s a good thing.
Pros
+
Intimate, deeply human look at Bruce during a dark period.
+
Strong performances from Jeremy Allen White and Jeremy Strong
+
Honest, emotionally authentic storytelling
+
Excellent audio mixing
Cons
-
Allen White isn’t Bruce, which may feel off to some
-
Slow pacing at times

For the

faithful – and probably those who feel that way about Jeremy Allen White – today, October 24, 2025, has been a long time coming, as
Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere
is finally showing in movie theaters across the globe.
Now, for lack of a better analogy, the Boss has been the soundtrack of my life – well, for most of it – so I headed to a local AMC Theatre with Dolby Cinema in the great state of New Jersey for an opening-night preview screening.
I had a lot of feelings going in, especially since
Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere
isn’t like most biopics. But I wouldn’t even call it that, because it focuses on a very specific, short time in Springsteen’s career. Instead of portraying the many months spent on getting
