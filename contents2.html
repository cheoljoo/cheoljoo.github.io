                <div class="summary">Uber has quietly begun piloting in-app video recording for its drivers in India, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company. The tool is meant to deter misconduct in a market where most drivers do not use dashcams, according to Uber. Half a dozen Uber drivers in the Delhi–NCR region told TechCrunch they sometimes face misconduct from riders and, in some cases, are threatened with false complaints about their behavior — allegations that can lead to penalties or even account suspensions. “Even female passengers traveling late at night insist that we follow the route they want instead of what’s shown on the map. If we refuse, they threaten to file false complaints,” said one driver, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing his account. Drivers said the in-app video recording feature could help protect them in such situations by providing evidence when disputes arise. Still, some questioned whether Uber would back them in cases involving riders, noting that passengers pay for the trip and can easily switch to competing platforms if dissatisfied. The pilot, which began rolling out in phases in May, is now live in 10 cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Riders receive an in-trip notification when video recording is active. Uber’s notification for in-app video recording

“All recordings are double-encrypted, stored on the device, and cannot be accessed by anyone — including Uber — unless a user chooses to share them as part of a safety report,” an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the recordings are automatically deleted after a week if they are not shared.

Mere hours after OpenAI updated its flagship foundation model
GPT-5 to GPT-5.1
, promising reduced token usage overall and a more pleasant personality with more preset options, Chinese search giant
Baidu unveiled its next-generation foundation model, ERNIE 5.0,
alongside a suite of AI product upgrades and strategic international expansions. The goal: to position as a global contender in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market. Announced at the company&#x27;s Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary, natively omni-modal model designed to jointly process and generate content across text, images, audio, and video. Unlike Baidu’s recently released
ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking
, which is open source under an enterprise-friendly and permissive Apache 2.0 license, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary model and is available only via
Baidu’s ERNIE Bot
website (I needed to select it manuallyu from the model picker dropdown) and the
Qianfan cloud platform application programming interface (API) for enterprise customers. Alongside the model launch, Baidu introduced major updates to its digital human platform, no-code tools, and general-purpose AI agents — all targeted at expanding its AI footprint beyond China. The company also introduced ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022, a variant optimized for text-intensive tasks, alongside the general preview model that balances across modalities.</div>

We got our first glimpse of the much-anticipated
second season
of
Fallout
(adapted from the popular video game franchise) in August when Prime Video released an extended teaser. We now have the official trailer, with all the deadpan humor, explosions, and mutant atrocities one could hope for—including ghoulish Elvis impersonators in New Vegas. (Spoilers for S1 below.)
As
previously reported
, in S1, we met Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), a young woman whose vault is raided by surface dwellers. The raiders kill many vault residents and kidnap her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan), so the sheltered Lucy sets out on a quest to find him. Life on the surface is pretty brutal, but Lucy learns fast. Along the way, she finds an ally (and love interest) in Maximus (Aaron Moten), a squire masquerading as a knight of the Brotherhood of Steel. And she runs afoul of a gunslinger and bounty hunter known as the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a former Hollywood actor named Cooper Howard who survived the original nuclear blast, but radiation exposure turned him into, well, a ghoul. The first season left off with Lucy deciding to join the Ghoul and the plucky dog CX404 (now named Dogmeat) to track down the leaders of Vault-Tec, revealed to have orchestrated the nuclear apocalypse—with Lucy’s father among them.</div>

President Donald Trump issued a ban
on “woke AI.” As outlined in a new blog post, Anthropic says it wants Claude to “treat opposing political viewpoints with equal depth, engagement, and quality of analysis.”
In July, Trump signed an executive order that says the government should only procure “unbiased” and “truth-seeking” AI models. Though this order only applies to government agencies, the changes companies make in response will likely trickle down to widely released AI models, since “refining models in a way that consistently and predictably aligns them in certain directions can be an expensive and time-consuming process,”

Apple will reportedly bring MLS games to its normal TV subscription

Apple is reportedly doing away with its Major League Soccer Season Pass and including next season&#x27;s soccer matches as part of its normal Apple TV subscription. That’s according to reports of a new MLS partnership agreement from
The Athletic
that’s similar to
a deal
the company made in October to bring F1 races to all subscribers. First announced in 2022, the
MLS Season Pass
remains one of Apple&#x27;s most significant forays into sports programming to date. As part of its original agreement with MLS, Apple became the exclusive way soccer fans streamed MLS games globally, eliminating any kind of regional blackout, as long as Apple TV was accessible. The company originally planned to offer some games as a free bonus for Apple TV subscribers, but three years later, a majority of MLS games require an additional $15 a month or $99 a season subscription (with discounts for existing Apple TV subscribers). Now all of that is going away, and anyone who pays
$13 a month for Apple TV
can keep up with their favorite team. Advertisement

&quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to bring MLS to more fans around the world next season on Apple TV,&quot; Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services, told
The Hollywood Reporter
in a statement. &quot;Every match, all in one place, alongside incredible Apple Originals — it&#x27;s a win for fans everywhere.&quot;
Engadget has contacted Apple for more details about its MLS plans. We&#x27;ll update this article if we hear back. While Apple hasn&#x27;t succeeded in locking down
NBA
or
NFL
games like its competitors Amazon and Google, the company has been slowly growing its sports ambitions.</div>

                <div class="summary">Deepwatch, a cybersecurity firm that makes an AI-powered detection and response platform, laid off dozens of employees on Wednesday, citing AI as one of the reasons.
John DiLullo, CEO at Deepwatch told TechCrunch in an email that the company “is aligning our organization to accelerate our significant investments in AI and automation.”
A current Deepwatch employee, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the press, told TechCrunch that the layoffs affected between 60 and 80 staffers, out of a workforce of around 250 employees. A
post on Linkedin
by a person who said they were laid off mentioned 80 people as well.
“They’re doing something with AI and agentic AI but it sounds like bullshit,” the current employee told TechCrunch.

Eight former Deepwatch employees announced that they were laid off, according to LinkedIn posts seen by TechCrunch.
Deepwatch is not the only cybersecurity company that has conducted layoffs this year. In May, cybersecurity giant
Crowdstrike laid off around 500 workers
, or 5% of its workforce. The cuts came despite a record year with “operating cash flow of $1.38 billion and record full year free cash flow of $1.07 billion,” according to a press release at the time.
Other cybersecurity companies
that have cut their workforce this year are Deep Instinct, Otorio, ActiveFence, SkyBox Security,
and Sophos

Another day in late 2025, another impressive result from a Chinese company in open source artificial intelligence.
Chinese social networking company
Weibo&#x27;s AI division recently released its open source VibeThinker-1.5B
—a 1.5 billion parameter large language model (LLM) that is a fine-tuned variant of rival Chinese tech firm
Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B.
It&#x27;s available now for free download and usage by researchers and enterprise developers—even for commercial purposes—under a permissive MIT License on
Hugging Face
,
GitHub
and
ModelScope
, with a
technical report
on open access science publishing site arxiv.org.
And yet, despite its compact size, VibeThinker-1.5B achieves benchmark-topping reasoning performance on math and code tasks, rivaling or surpassing models hundreds of times its size, even outperforming Chinese rival DeepSeek&#x27;s famed R1 that went viral at the start of this year—a 671-billion parameter model—on formal reasoning benchmark.
It further eclipses Mistral AI&#x27;s Magistral Medium and holds its own against Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4 and OpenAI&#x27;s gpt-oss-20B Medium, all while requiring a fraction of the infrastructure and investment.
It also does so having been post-trained on a budget of merely $7800 USD for compute resources (3900 GPU hours on Nvidia H800s) — far less than the tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of dollars typically required to fine-tune models of similar or larger scale.
Recall this is not the total cost of the model&#x27;s development, however: LLMs are trained in stages. First comes pre-training, when the model learns basic language structure and general knowledge by predicting the next word across enormous amounts of text from the internet, books, and articles.</div>

Alien Earth
will return to FX (and Disney+ and Hulu) for a second season, thanks to a new deal between Disney and series creator Noah Hawley.
The new season has no air date yet, but we do know one thing about it: It will be shot in London. The first season was shot in Thailand, and most of the story took place in Southeast Asia, so the change in shooting location suggests a new setting for much of the next season. Production on season two will
reportedly
begin next year.
For those who watched season one to its conclusion, season two probably seemed like a sure thing; the finale resolved many of the core conflicts of that first batch of episodes, but also was clearly intended to be the launching point for a new storyline in season two.
That instinct is probably right—there was almost likely to be a season two, but the real question was whether Hawley would return as its creative lead. That was contingent on dealmaking between Hawley, FX, and Disney Entertainment Television. That deal has been made, reportedly to the tune of
nine figures.
“I had to plan and execute a story that’s going someplace,” Hawley told
The Hollywood Reporter
regarding
Alien Earth’
s first season. “And then, this whole thing is a proof-of-concept experiment to see if enough people on the planet want to watch an Alien TV show to justify the expense of a second and third season of an Alien TV show. So for me, I never hedged my bets.</div>

12,000+ classified docs reveal deep links between Knownsec and Chinese state cyber operations
The breach involved Remote Access Trojans capable of attacking global operating systems
Researchers found 95GB of immigration data stolen from India’s national databases
A recent data breach at Chinese security firm Knownsec has revealed over 12,000 classified files tied to state-owned cyber operations.
The leaked materials reportedly include details on “cyber weapons,” internal
AI tools
, and an extensive list of international targets.
The incident has not only exposed technical data but also shown how deeply a private company can be embedded in national cyber programs.

Despite swift takedown efforts on GitHub, where some files briefly appeared, the contents have already circulated among researchers and intelligence analysts.
The documents appear to offer a rare look into China’s cyber ecosystem, showing links between Knownsec and various government departments.
The leaked files outline a number of global targets, naming over twenty countries and regions, including Japan, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the UK.
Among the most concerning revelations are spreadsheets that reportedly detail attacks on 80 foreign targets, including critical infrastructure and telecommunications companies.</div>
