Two of the Kremlin’s most active hacking units recently were spotted collaborating in malware attacks that compromise high-value devices located in Ukraine, security researchers said Friday.
One of the groups is Turla, which is easily one of the world’s most sophisticated advanced persistent threats (well-organized and well-funded hacking groups, many backed by nation states, that target specific adversaries for years at a time). Researchers from multiple security firms largely agree that Turla was behind breaches of
the
US Department of Defense in 2008
, and more recently, the
German Foreign Office
and France&#x27;s military. The group has also been known for
unleashing stealthy Linux malware
and using
satellite-based Internet links
to maintain the stealth of its operations
. The group conducts narrowly targeted attacks on high-value targets and keeps a low profile.
Gamaredon, meanwhile, is a separate APT known for conducting much wider-scale operations, often targeting organizations in Ukraine. Whereas Turla takes pains to fly under the radar, Gamaredon doesn’t seem to care about being detected and linked to the Russian government. Its malware generally aims to collect as much information from targets as possible over a short period of time. Both Turla and Gamaredon are widely assessed to be units of Russia’s Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the country’s chief security agency and successor of the Soviet Union’s KGB.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji
is the action role-playing game’s (RPGs) first major expansion since launch, adding a whole new island to explore, and with a refined, handcrafted focus when compared to the base game’s sprawling offering. Over ten hours or so,
Claws of Awaji
finally gives Shinobi protagonist Naoe a proper ending, and it’s an essential experience for those looking to finish off Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows’ story.
Claws of Awaji’s
opening mission sets out what’s to follow clearly and creatively. Alongside Junjiro (the Hideout&#x27;s rambunctious child), Naoe attends a puppet show, where details of the main protagonist’s long-lost Mother have started to emerge. This is when things take a turn, as you play through a 2.5D side-scrolling mission from the perspective of the mysterious Tsuyu, Naoe’s Mother, turned Master Assassin. You go from rooftops to a leap of faith into a darkened courtyard filled with enemies.
Claws of Awaji
places emphasis on the shadow-based gameplay that I found to be underutilized in the main game, as you extinguish candles and lights to close the distance on foes.
Chronicles of Tsuyu

Throughout this opening mission, I’m taken back to reflect on one of the most underrated games in the series:
Assassin’s Creed Chronicles
. This was a series of three side-scrolling vignettes set in China, India, and Russia, each focusing on a different Assassin and story.

Microsoft is raising the prices of its Xbox Series S / X consoles in the US next month. The Xbox Series X will be priced at $649.99 in the US starting October 3rd, up from its existing $599.99 price. The Xbox Series S will move to $399.99, up from $379.99.
Microsoft blames
the price hikes on “changes in the macroeconomic environment,” which is a lot of words to say:
tariffs
. Xbox console pricing outside the US will remain the same. Thankfully, pricing for controllers and headsets will remain in the same in the US.
The price rises mean Xbox Series S consoles will increase by $20, Xbox Series X consoles by $50, and the 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition Xbox Series X is increasing by $70 all the way up to $799.99.
Here’s the full list of price increases in the US:

Starting on October 3, Microsoft says Xbox consoles will be getting
yet another price bump
, this time ranging anywhere from a $20 increase on the company&#x27;s entry-level model to $70 for a special edition model with 2TB of storage. If all of this sounds familiar, there&#x27;s a good reason, the last time xbox prices were raised was
only a few months ago
in May.
The price increases breakdown as follows:
Xbox Series S (512GB):
$400, up $20 from $380
Xbox Series S (1TB):
$450 up $20 from $430
Xbox Series X Digital:
$600, up $50 from $550
Xbox Series X:
$650, up $50 from $600
Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition:
$800, up $70 from $730
Those are fairly significant increases, especially when you start comparing Microsoft&#x27;s higher-end Xbox Series X consoles
to the competition.
For example, the Series X Digital (which doesn&#x27;t have a disc drive) now costs $50 more than a PS5 Digital Edition. For the $800 Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition, price comparisons are even worse. It&#x27;s now more expensive than the $750 PS5 Pro, and at least Sony&#x27;s console gets you better performance for its high price.

Engadget has reached out to Microsoft for more information on the price changes. We&#x27;ll update this article if we hear back.
As of right now, Microsoft credits the need to raise prices on &quot;changes in the macroeconomic environment,&quot; which likely has to do with the impact
tariffs
implemented by the Trump administration are having on importing electronics into the US. It&#x27;s worth noting, however, that the company has also been shifting its focus away from home consoles in favor of bringing the &quot;Xbox experience&quot; to other platforms.

                <div class="summary">Top tech names were on the guest list for the banquet thrown for President Trump during his second state visit to the UK on Wednesday.
The banquet seating chart included NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang; Apple CEO Tim Cook; venture capitalist and White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks; Alphabet and Google president Ruth Porat; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff; and OpenAI’s Sam Altman,
according to the New York Times
.
On Thursday, the US and UK signed
a partnership
called the Tech Prosperity Deal to focus on developing nuclear, AI, and quantum technologies. Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and OpenAI also made announcements earlier this week to build data centers in the UK, while CoreWeave and Salesforce
announced a multi-billion-pound
investment in the country. Overall, American tech firms committed a total of £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost AI infrastructure in the UK.
This state banquet guest list seems to have featured more tech and business names
rather than the Hollywood types
that often attend such affairs.
This change reveals the shifting economic needs of the UK and US in the age of AI, and the
rising prominence of technology
and its leaders in Trump’s second administration. Just this past year, numerous Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Apple have pledged to work with the government, from
providing AI assistant tools
to government services to
building digital health ecosystems
for the U.S. health industry.
The president has also taken a sharper focus on tech — criticizing Tim Cook
for Apple’s outsourced supply chain
, signing an “
anti-work
” AI order, as well as instructing the attorney general to investigate
private companies receiving federal funds
that have DEI programs deemed “illegal.”
Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and other tech leaders attended the president’s inauguration this year. And, in early September, President Trump threw a tech dinner with 33 top names in Silicon Valley, including Altman, Cook, and Zuckerberg.</div>

Days after someone revealed the news on social media, Samsung confirmed today that it is showing advertisements on some US customers’ smart fridges. Samsung said the ads showing on some Family Hub-series fridges are part of a pilot program, but we suspect that they may become more permanent additions to Samsung fridges and/or other types of screen-equipped smart home appliances.
In a statement sent to Ars Technica, Samsung confirmed that it is “conducting a pilot program to offer promotions and curated advertisements on certain Samsung Family Hub refrigerator models in the US market.”
Samsung currently lists nine Family Hub refrigerators in the US, which have MSRPs ranging
from $1,800 to $3,500
. Family Hub fridges have 21.5- or 32-inch screens, which, until now, users have had autonomy over for displaying helpful or fun things, like photos and videos, memos, weather, timers, and a web browser. Some of those abilities require a Wi-Fi connection or a Samsung account.
Now, Samsung is commandeering some of the screens already set up in homes to display ads. As Samsung’s rep explained:
As a part of this pilot program, Family Hub refrigerators in the US will receive an over-the-network (OTN) software update with Terms of Service (T&amp;C) and Privacy Notice (PN). Advertising will appear on certain Family Hub refrigerator Cover Screens. The Cover Screen appears when a Family Hub screen is idle.</div>

Marshall Kilburn III

The Marshall Kilburn III serves up an incredible combination of beautifully balanced audio, meaty features and premium aesthetic. Its 50-hour battery life means you’ll barely ever have to charge it too. Sure, it’s more costly than its predecessor was at launch, and you can get better protection against the elements from rivals like the Xtreme 4, but the Kilburn III is still one of the best-sounding (and looking) models in its weight class.
Pros
Exceptional battery life
Classy amp-inspired design
Highly effective placement compensation
Cons
Inferior IP rating to Xtreme 4
No multi-speaker pairing
Not as portable as JBL’s speaker
JBL Xtreme 4
$267.99
at Newegg
$299.95
at Walmart
$360.95
at Crutchfield
$369.95
at Best Buy
The JBL Xtreme 4 delivers each musical element with clarity and distinction and packs in some nifty features that build on the strengths of its predecessor. It&#x27;s a rugged, outdoorsy speaker that doesn’t go all out on style, but hits all the right notes when it comes to utility, boasting a great battery life and IP67 dustproof and waterproof rating.
Pros
Ultra-rugged design
Seriously powerful audio output
Considerably lighter than Kilburn III
Cons
Requires EQ tuning to sound its best
Lower battery life than Kilburn III
Exterior design lacks sex appeal

At its Connect keynote on Wednesday, Meta officially
introduced the $799.99 Meta Ray-Ban Display
, also known as Hypernova. The brand’s new, high-end smart glasses feature an in-lens display you can control with wrist-based gestures via the new Meta Neural Band that’s included. The display pairs with your phone and allows you to see everything from text messages and Instagram Reels to maps and more — all without having to pull out your device. They seem like a more fully-realized version of
Google Glass
, and they’ll be released on September 30th.</div>

Meta&#x27;s lineup of smart glasses could soon get a lot more capabilities. The company will begin allowing outside developers to bring their apps to its RayBan and Oakley smart glasses, Meta
announced
on the second day of its Connect event.
Up to now, Meta has only had a limited number of third-party integrations for its glasses, with apps like Spotify and Audible. But Meta will now allow developers to start experimenting with apps that can take advantage of the built-in sensors and audio capabilities of its glasses. This means other companies will be able to create their own custom experiences that use Meta&#x27;s
multimodal AI
features.
The company is already working with a set of early partners, like Twitch, which is creating livestreaming capabilities for the glasses, and Disney, which is experimenting with an app for inside its parks. A demo video shows a visitor walking around Disneyland and asking the AI assistant about the rides she&#x27;s seeing and other park information. 18Birdies, a golf app, is working on an integration that can give players club recommendations and yardage stats.

Notably, these apps all seem like they work with Meta&#x27;s non-display glasses, which means that even people who have first-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses could see a bunch of added new functionality. It&#x27;s not clear if the company will also allow developers to also build experiences that can take advantage of the display on its newest
Meta Ray-Ban Display
frames, but that could open up even more possibilities.
Meta&#x27;s new set of tools, officially called the &quot;Wearables Device Access Toolkit,&quot; will roll out as a
limited developer preview
ahead of broader availability in 2026.
