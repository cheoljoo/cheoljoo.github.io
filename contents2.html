Mayuyo reportedly posted additional threats during the investigation and was taken into custody after a 90-minute negotiation. His X account was suspended for violating hateful content policy, and he had previously criticized TikTokShop USA on Medium. This incident occurs as TikTok&#x27;s U.S. operations are being spun out from ByteDance, a sale recently approved by President Donald Trump.</div>

                <div class="summary">Derek Chang argues against replacing coders with AI, despite the seductive narrative of AI as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; for automation. He contends that while AI excels at simple tasks, it struggles with complex, proprietary infrastructure code due to its limited training data and inability to reason or have instincts. Chang, drawing from his experience with industry leaders, emphasizes that AI currently functions as a junior team member requiring oversight, and that senior professionals are still crucial for identifying flaws and understanding long-term risks. He warns business leaders that over-reliance on AI for sophisticated projects could backfire, advocating for a shift from replacing humans to reinforcing them to maximize AI&#x27;s benefits.</div>

The update, available in the Microsoft Store, leverages local AI computation for automatic classification of images into categories like receipts and screenshots, and includes a &quot;super resolution&quot; feature for upscaling low-resolution photos without cloud reliance. However, this exclusivity to Copilot+ PCs, which require Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm chips with NPU units, limits accessibility for most current Windows users, positioning the app more as a showcase for Microsoft&#x27;s new hardware strategy than a universal solution.</div>

Martin Keary, VP of product at Muse, detailed significant improvements aimed at addressing long-standing user experience issues, particularly minimizing &quot;Audacity says &#x27;no&#x27;&quot; scenarios where the software arbitrarily restricts actions. Key enhancements include changes to UI behavior for smoother clip manipulation, elimination of restrictive &quot;modes,&quot; and the addition of individual track meters, easier trimming/time stretching, and a split tool. The controversial Sync Lock feature is also being revamped for a more intuitive multi-track workflow. The update aims for a more customizable and modern interface, marking a major step forward for the software.</div>

While details about the pocket-sized, display-less device remain scarce, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has offered some clues.

If you’re not an AI startup, good luck raising money from VCs
New PitchBook data illustrates how dramatically AI is dominating startup investment, with 2025 on-track to become the first year when AI accounts for more than half of all VC money invested.
PitchBook reports that VCs have poured $192.7 billion into the industry so far this year, out of a total $366.8 billion,
according to Bloomberg
. In the most recent quarter, AI accounted for 62.7% of the money invested by U.S. VCs, and for 53.2% of money invested by global firms.
Most of that money is going to marquee names like Anthropic, which announced
a $13 billion Series F
in September. Meanwhile, the number of startups and venture funds successfully raising money are at their lowest levels in years — PitchBook says that 823 funds have been raised globally so far in 2025, compared to 4,430 in 2022.
PitchBook’s director of research Kyle Sanford told Bloomberg that the market is becoming “bifurcated,” where “you’re in AI, or you’re not” and “you’re a big firm, or you’re not.”

                <div class="summary">Huawei&#x27;s new open source technique shrinks LLMs to make them run on less powerful, less expensive hardware
Carl Franzen
October 3, 2025
Huawei’s Computing Systems Lab in Zurich has introduced a
new open-source quantization method
for large language models (LLMs) aimed at reducing memory demands without sacrificing output quality.
The technique, called
SINQ (Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization)
, is designed to be fast, calibration-free, and easy to integrate into existing model workflows. The code for performing it has been made available by the Huawei research team on
Github
and
Hugging Face
under a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, allowing organizations to take and use it, modify it, and deploy it commercially — all for free.
Across models of different sizes, SINQ cuts memory usage by
60–70%
, depending on architecture and bit-width.
This enables models that would previously require &gt;60 GB of memory to run on
~20 GB setups
—a critical enabler for running large models on a single high-end GPU or even multi-GPU consumer-grade setups.
This makes it possible to run models that previously needed high-end enterprise GPUs—like NVIDIA’s A100 or H100—on significantly more affordable hardware, such as a single
Nvidia GeForce
RTX 4090
(
around $1600
), instead of enterprise hardware like the
A100 80GB
(
$19,000
) or even
H100
units that
exceed $30,000
.
For teams using cloud infrastructure, the savings are similarly tangible. A100-based instances often cost $3–4.50 per hour, while 24 GB GPUs like the RTX 4090 are available on many platforms for $1–1.50 per hour.
Over time, especially for extended inference workloads, this difference can add up to
thousands of dollars in cost reductions
, while also unlocking LLM deployment on smaller clusters, local workstations, or consumer-grade setups previously constrained by memory.
Tackling the Memory Challenge of LLMs
Running large models often requires compromises between performance and size.</div>

Around this time each year, the US Space Force convenes a Mission Assignment Board to dole out contracts to launch the nation&#x27;s most critical national security satellites. The military announced this year&#x27;s launch orders Friday, and SpaceX was the big winner.
Space Systems Command, the unit responsible for awarding military launch contracts, selected SpaceX to launch five of the seven missions up for assignment this year. United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, won contracts for the other two. These missions for the Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office are still at least a couple of years away from flying.
SpaceX and ULA are the only companies with rockets certified by the Space Force to launch the Pentagon&#x27;s big-ticket satellites. ULA&#x27;s Vulcan rocket, which replaces the company&#x27;s Atlas V, debuted nearly two years ago and successfully launched its
first national security mission in August
. SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets each have long track records of success.</div>

                <div class="summary">TechRadar Verdict
The Levoit EverestAir is one of the most effective air purifiers I&#x27;ve ever tested. It&#x27;s powerful enough to clean extra-large rooms, but has a slim, compact design that easily fits in small spaces (with the vents adjusted to suit). It can filter a wide variety of particles – including efficiently getting rid of odors – and information is presented clearly and logically. The filter is rather expensive, and it might be overkill for a small room, but otherwise this purifier is a winner.

Levoit EverestAir air purifier: two-minute review
Air purifiers designed for large rooms tend to be big and bulky – but the Levoit EverestAir Air Purifier is an exception to that rule. It&#x27;s a slim machine that can fit into tight spaces, and fit flush against a wall, but which packs enough power to use in extra-large spaces.
Inside, you&#x27;ll find a 3-stage filtration system that includes a washable pre-filter, and a H13 True HEPA filter and an activated charcoal filter combo.</div>

Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days
may bring some great Kindle deals, but if you can’t wait, you don’t have to. Right now, the Kindle Kids (
Amazon

Best Buy

Target
) and Kindle Colorsoft Kids (
Amazon
,
Best Buy

Target
) are down to their lowest prices ever, but my favorite deal is on the
Kindle Paperwhite Kids
, which sits nicely between the two. Normally $179.99, right now it’s on sale for $134.99 ($45 off) at
