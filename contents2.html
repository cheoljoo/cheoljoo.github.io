! It’s been a minute, folks! As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition. I spent the first week of the year at the
Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this
last January
, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building. What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (
Zoox
,
Tensor Auto
,
Tier IV
, and
Waymo
, which
rebranded its Zeekr RT
, to name a few), Chinese automakers like
Geely
and
GWM
, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
calls “physical AI.”
The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables. Hyundai
had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the
Atlas humanoid robot
, courtesy of its subsidiary
Boston Dynamics
. There were also innovations that have come out of
Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB
, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into p...</div>

Stop calling it &#x27;The AI bubble&#x27;: It&#x27;s actually multiple bubbles, each with a different expiration date
Val Bercovici, WEKA
January 18, 2026
CleoP made with Midjourney
It’s the question on everyone’s minds and lips: Are we in an AI bubble? It&#x27;s the wrong question. The real question is:
Which
AI bubble are we in, and when will each one burst? The debate over whether AI represents a
transformative technology
or an economic time bomb has reached a fever pitch. Even tech leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have acknowledged evidence of an unstable financial bubble forming around AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates see clear bubble dynamics: overexcited investors, frothy valuations and plenty of doomed projects — but they still believe AI will ultimately transform the economy. But treating &quot;AI&quot; as a single monolithic entity destined for a uniform collapse is fundamentally misguided. The AI ecosystem is actually three distinct layers, each with different economics, defensibility and risk profiles. Understanding these layers is critical, because they won&#x27;t all pop at once. Layer 3: The wrapper companies (first to fall)
The most vulnerable segment isn&#x27;t building AI — it&#x27;s repackaging it. These are the companies that take OpenAI&#x27;s API, add a slick interface and some prompt engineering, then charge $49/month for what amounts to a glorified ChatGPT wrapper. Some have achieved rapid initial success, like
Jasper.ai
, which reached approximately $42 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in its first year by wrapping GPT models in a user-friendly interface for marketers. But the cracks are already showing. These businesses face threats from every direction:
Feature absorption
: Microsoft can bundle your $50/month AI writing tool into Office 365 tomorrow. Google can make your AI email assistant a free Gmail feature. Salesforce can build your AI...</div>

The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a
study
published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance. “For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”
The social cost of carbon is an accounting method for working out the monetary cost of each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.</div>

Welcome to Night Vale
is the longest continually running fiction podcast out there. (Some will argue it’s actually
We’re Alive
, but that has taken a few significant breaks between seasons.) The story of Night Vale, the titular desert town, now spans 12 seasons, over 280 episodes,
three books
, and at least
10 live standalone shows
. While dedicating several hundred hours of your life to listening to every episode might seem like a big ask, I believe you’ll be hooked once you dive in. The show is written by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor, who draw heavily on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. Every season has its own arc, but broadly, the show tells the story of a tow...</div>

Microsoft issues emergency fix after a security update left some Windows 11 devices unable to shut down
The &quot;out-of-band&quot; updates also address users not being able to log in remotely. Jackson Chen

If you weren&#x27;t able to shut down your Windows 11 device recently, Microsoft has rolled out an
emergency fix
addressing a couple of critical bugs that popped up with its latest January 2026 Windows security update. The latest &quot;out-of-band&quot; update repairs an issue for some Windows 11 devices that would only restart when users tried to shut down or hibernate. The same update restores the ability for Windows 10 and Windows 11 users to log into their devices via remote connection apps. Microsoft said the inability to shut down or hibernate affected Windows 11 devices using Secure Launch, a security feature that protects a computer from firmware-level attacks during startup. As for the remote connection issue, Microsoft explained in its
Known issues page
that credential prompt failures were responsible when users tried to log in remotely to affected Windows 10 and 11 devices. According to
WindowsLatest
, some lingering issues with the January 2026 Windows security update are still affecting users, like seeing blank screens or Outlook Classic crashing. Back in October, Microsoft had to issue another emergency fix for Windows 11 related to the
Windows Recovery Environment
. For those still hesitant to upgrade to Windows 11, Microsoft is allowing you to squeeze some more life out of Windows 10 by enrolling in
Extended Security Updates

                <div class="summary">Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like
high-throughput screening
, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.
Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company
completed its Series B
, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.
Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a
deal
in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.
It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia
on a $1 billion partnership
to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.
The industry isn’t
without its detractors

Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup,
Listen Labs
, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s
$100 million offers
seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a
billboard in San Francisco
displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by
Ribbit Capital
with participation from
Evantic
and existing investors
Sequoia Capital
,
Conviction
, and
Pear VC
. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.
&quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&quot;

Big Tech’s AI-fueled memory shortage
is set to be the PC industry’s defining story for 2026 and beyond. Standalone, direct-to-consumer RAM kits were some of the first products to feel the bite, with prices spiking by 300 or 400 percent
by the end of 2025
; prices for SSDs had also increased noticeably, albeit more modestly.
The rest of 2026 is going to be all about where, how, and to what extent those price spikes flow downstream into
computers
, phones, and other components that use RAM and NAND chips—areas where the existing supply of products and longer-term supply contracts negotiated by big companies have helped keep prices from surging too noticeably so far.
This week, we’re seeing signs that the RAM crunch is starting to affect the GPU market—Asus made some waves when it inadvertently
announced
that it was discontinuing its
GeForce RTX 5070 Ti
.
Though the company has tried to walk this announcement back since then, if you’re a GPU manufacturer, there’s a strong argument to be made for either discontinuing this model or de-prioritizing it in favor of other GPUs. The 5070 Ti uses 16GB of GDDR7, plus a partially disabled ve...</div>

Big Tech, AI firms, and search engines all help to fund Wikipedia
The Wikimedia Foundation has seven data centers globally
Perplexity has gifted Wikipedia editors 2,500 free Enterprise seats
Tech giants including Ecosia,
Microsoft
, Mistral AI, Perplexity, Pleias, and ProRata are some of the latest companies to have signed up to pay the Wikimedia Foundation an undisclosed amount for premium access to Wikipedia content, the body
announced
in a post to commemorate its 25-year anniversary.
Amazon
,
Google
, and Meta, some of the Foundation&#x27;s earlier members, have already been using the commercial API to to &quot;access content from Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed.&quot;
This revenue is designed to support Wikimedia&#x27;s nonprofit mission and long-term sustainability, but there&#x27;s also a bigger AI story at play.
