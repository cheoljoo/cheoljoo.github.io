                <div class="summary">​If you thought 2025 couldn’t get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended.
Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by
acquiring Warner Bros.
’ film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.
​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. It’s not only historic in its size but also predicted to
disrupt Hollywood
as we know it.
We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next.
What has happened so far?
​This all started back in October when WBD
revealed it was exploring a potential sale
after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.
For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by
declining cable viewership
and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.
​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with
Paramount
initially viewed as the frontrunner.

                <div class="summary">Researchers broke every AI defense they tested. Here are 7 questions to ask vendors.
Louis Columbus
January 23, 2026
Security teams are buying AI defenses that don&#x27;t work. Researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind published findings in October 2025 that should stop every CISO mid-procurement. Their paper, &quot;
The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against Llm Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections
,&quot; tested 12 published AI defenses, with most claiming near-zero attack success rates. The research team achieved bypass rates above 90% on most defenses. The implication for enterprises is stark: Most AI security products are being tested against attackers that don’t behave like real attackers.
The team tested prompting-based, training-based, and filtering-based defenses under adaptive attack conditions. All collapsed. Prompting defenses achieved 95% to 99% attack success rates under adaptive attacks. Training-based methods fared no better, with bypass rates hitting 96% to 100%. The researchers designed a rigorous methodology to stress-test those claims. Their approach included 14 authors and a $20,000 prize pool for successful attacks.
Researchers tested 12 AI defenses across four categories. All claimed near-zero attack success rates. All were bypassed at rates above 90%. Source: The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against LLM Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections, October 2025
Why WAFs fail at the inference layer
Web application firewalls (WAFs) are stateless; AI attacks are not. The distinction explains why traditional security controls collapse against modern prompt injection techniques.
The researchers threw known jailbreak techniques at these defenses.

The Trump White House yesterday posted a manipulated photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney who was arrested after protesting in a church where a pastor is allegedly also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem
posted
what seems to be the original photo of Armstrong being led away by an officer yesterday morning. A half hour later, the official White House X account
posted
an altered version in which Armstrong’s face was manipulated to make it appear that she was crying.
“The White House shared an AI-edited photo of Nekima, depicting her in tears and scared when, in actuality, she was poised, determined, and unafraid,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson
said
yesterday.
Reader-added context on X said, “This photo has been digitally altered to make Nekima Levy Armstrong appear to be in distress. The Director of DHS herself posted the unedited photo in an earlier announcement.” White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr defended the post after criticism of the image manipulation.

Asus confirms no new phones for 2026 - leaving Zenfone and ROG lines frozen indefinitely
Smartphone profits shrink as users upgrade more slowly and hardware gains feel marginal
Chinese brands are squeezing margins, making yearly phone launches risky for smaller brands
Asus has confirmed it will stop producing new
smartphone
models, effectively freezing both the Zenfone and ROG Phone product lines.
Company CEO Jonney Shih made the statement during a recent company event in Taiwan, clarifying that no new mobile phones are planned for 2026 and beyond.
Stating, “Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future,” Shih avoided calling it a permanent exit, but its language points to an indefinite halt rather than a temporary delay.

Meta is “temporarily pausing” the ability for teens to chat with its AI characters as it develops a “new version” of the characters that will offer a “better experience.” The company made the announcement in an update to a blog post
from October
where the company had detailed more parental controls for teen AI use. The change blocking teens from accessing the characters will go into effect “starting in the coming weeks.”
”Since we announced our plans to build parental controls for AI characters in October, we started developing a new iteration of AI characters generally (i.e. for both adults and teens),” spokesperson Sophie Vogel tells
The Verge
. “Rather than building the parental controls twice (for the current AI characters and the new iteration of AI char...</div>

Retro handheld maker Anbernic has a new gamepad with a screen and heart rate sensor
Sure, why not!

The Anbernic RG G01 has a 2.5-inch LCD.

File this one under &quot;Things that make you go, &#x27;Hmmm…&#x27;&quot;
Retro handheld maker Anbernic
is
launching
a new controller with a screen. But unlike Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U controller, there&#x27;s no second-screen gaming capability here. Instead, the display is designed to &quot;make customization intuitive and effortless.&quot; Oh, and the controller also has a heart rate sensor. Because, hey, if you&#x27;re going weird, I say fully commit!
The Anbernic RG G01 has a 2.5-inch HD display that the company describes as an &quot;HD smart screen.&quot; The idea is to remap buttons, program macros and change other settings without requiring software on a connected device.
You, too, can monitor your heart rate while gaming.
(Anbernic)
Meanwhile, Anbernic says the heart rate detection helps you &quot;monitor your well-being during intense sessions.&quot; I would hope that folks with heart conditions would use something other than a gamepad to monitor their pulse. And I don’t know why anyone else would be worried about that while gaming. (Too many Red Bulls?) Regardless, Anbernic seems to be leaning into the novelty / curiosity space here, so at least it fits the motif.

The RG G01 connects in three ways: Bluetooth 5.0, 2.4Ghz wireless and over a wire. It supports onboard calibration for the triggers, joystick and 6-axis gyroscope. There are four programmable buttons (including macro support) on the backside. The company promises a 1,000Hz polling rate in wired and wireless modes. The gamepad is compatible with PC, Switch, Android and iOS.

                <div class="summary">Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has just announced a satellite internet network called
TeraWave
, which will be capable of offering data speeds up to 6 Tbps, and geared toward enterprise, data center, and government customers. The TeraWave constellation will use a mix of 5,280 satellites in low-Earth orbit and 128 in medium-Earth orbit, and Blue Origin plans to deploy the first ones in late 2027. It’s not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network. The low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6 Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX’s Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps — though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer
1 Gbps data transfer
in the future. “TeraWave adds a space-based layer to your existing network infrastructure, providing connectivity to locations unreachable by traditional methods,” the new website for the satellite network reads. The announcement of the TeraWave network comes just a few months after Bezos’ other company, Amazon, announced a rebrand of its own satellite network geared toward consumers. That network,
called Leo
, will ultimately consist of around 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit and offers more traditional broadband speeds. Taken together, these two networks could provide more robust competition to SpaceX’s Starlink, which has become the leading satellite internet provider with more than 9 million customers. Starlink currently sells its connectivity to regular consumers, commercial customers (like airlines), and governments. That said, the two networks from Amazon and Blue Origin are distinct.

For the modern CFO, the hardest part of the job often isn&#x27;t the math—it&#x27;s the storytelling. After the books are closed and the variances calculated, finance teams spend days, sometimes weeks, manually copy-pasting charts into PowerPoint slides to explain why the numbers moved. Today, 11-year-old Israeli fintech company
Datarails
announced a set of new generative AI tools designed to automate that &quot;last mile&quot; of financial reporting, effectively allowing finance leaders to &quot;vibe code&quot; their way to a board deck. Launching today to accompany the firm&#x27;s newly announced $70 million Series C funding round,
the company’s new Strategy, Planning, and Reporting AI Finance Agents
promise to answer complex financial questions with fully formatted assets, not just text. A finance professional can now ask, &quot;What’s driving our profitability changes this year?&quot; or &quot;Why did Marketing go over budget last month?&quot; and the system will instantly generate board-ready PowerPoint slides, PDF reports, or Excel files containing the answer. The deployment of these agents marks a fundamental shift in how the &quot;Office of the CFO&quot; interacts with data. Beyond the chatbot
The promise of the new agents is to solve the fragmentation problem that plagues finance departments. Unlike a sales leader who lives in Salesforce, or a CIO who relies on ServiceNow, the CFO has no single &quot;system of truth&quot;. Data is scattered across ERPs, HRIS, CRMs, and bank portals. A major barrier to AI adoption in finance has been security. CFOs are rightfully hesitant to plug P&amp;L data into public models. Datarails has addressed this by leveraging Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI...</div>

Researchers at Princeton University have built a swarm of interconnected mini-robots that “bloom” like flowers in response to changing light levels in an office. According to their
new paper
published in the journal Science Robotics, such robotic swarms could one day be used as dynamic facades in architectural designs, enabling buildings to adapt to changing climate conditions as well as interact with humans in creative ways. The authors drew inspiration from so-called “living architectures,” such as beehives. Fire ants provide
a textbook example
of this kind of collective behavior. A few ants spaced well apart behave like individual ants. But pack enough of them closely together, and they behave more like a single unit, exhibiting both solid and liquid properties. You can pour them from a teapot like ants, as Goldman’s lab demonstrated several years ago, or they can link together to build towers or floating rafts—a handy survival skill when, say, a hurricane floods Houston. They
also excel
at regulating their own traffic flow. You almost never see an ant traffic jam. Naturally scientists are keen to mimic such systems. For instance,
in 2018
, Georgia Tech researchers built ant-like robots and programmed them to dig through 3D-printed magnetic plastic balls designed to simulate moist soil. Robot swarms capable of efficiently digging underground without jamming would be super beneficial for mining or disast...</div>

Roku streaming sticks don&#x27;t come with an HDMI cable in their box
... but you can still get one for free if you ask
The request process is simple and should only take a few minutes
If you’ve tried a few different streaming stick brands, you’ll have noticed that
Roku
sticks lack a bonus HDMI cable that you’d get for free with an
Amazon
Fire Stick. Well, it turns out you can get this cable for free with Roku sticks too – if you know where to ask. Whether you’re upgrading an older TV, want access to your favorite streamed content when you travel, or have some other need for one, streaming sticks from the likes of Amazon and Roku can be super handy. But based on the design and port layout of your TV, and the other devices you have connected, it can be tricky to plug a streaming stick directly into your display – which is why Amazon Fire Sticks and others can come with an HDMI extender, a short additionable cable that creates more space between your stick and screen.
