                <div class="summary">Scale AI, which helps tech companies prepare data to train their AI models, filed a lawsuit against one of its former sales employees and its rival Mercor on Wednesday. The suit claims the employee, who was hired by Mercor, “stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information,” according to a copy seen by TechCrunch. Scale is suing Mercor for misappropriation of trade secrets and is suing the former employee, Eugene Ling, for breach of contract. The suit also claims the employee was trying to pitch Mercor to one of Scale’s largest customers before he officially left his former job. The suit calls this company “Customer A.”
Mercor co-founder Surya Midha denies that his company used any data from Scale, although he admits that Ling may have been in possession of some. “While Mercor has hired many people who departed Scale, we have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way. Eugene informed us that he had old documents in a personal Google Drive, which we have never accessed and are now investigating,” Midha told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “We reached out to Scale six days ago offering to have Eugene destroy the files or reach a different resolution, and we are now awaiting their response,” Midha said. Scale alleges that these documents contained the specific data that would allow Mercor to serve Customer A, as well as several other of Scale’s most important clients. Scale wanted Mercor to give it a full list of the files in the drive, and to prevent Ling from working with Customer A. It alleges in the suit that Mercor refused. Ling did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Techcrunch event

Queen once asked, &quot;
Who wants to live forever
?&quot; And while the band&#x27;s frontman Freddie Mercury only made it into his 40s, the song&#x27;s question continues to haunt people—especially aging tyrants who fear that the icy hand of death is upon their shoulder and want far more time to ensure both national and personal glory. At a Beijing gathering this week, China&#x27;s Xi Jinping, Russia&#x27;s Vladimir Putin, and North Korea&#x27;s Kim Jong Un met to commemorate Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. The three men and their translators were caught on hot mics having an &quot;unscripted moment&quot; in which the conversation turned to life extensions and immortality. &quot;Earlier, people rarely lived to 70, but these days at 70 years you are still a child,&quot; Xi told the other two,
according to Bloomberg
. (This is gross hyperbole, of course, as China&#x27;s
overall life expectancy rate is 77.6
, while
in Russia it is just 70
—below the global average of 71.4. The US average is 76.4.)
Putin then responded with the somewhat creepy claim that, thanks to biotech, &quot;human organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality.&quot;
Xi then responded with the claim that people may live to 150 by the end of this century. In a later press conference, Putin confirmed the discussion and said that &quot;life expectancy will increase significantly&quot; in the near future and &quot;we should also think about this&quot; in terms of political and economic consequences.</div>

Acer Veriton GN100 uses Nvidia GB10 superchip with 128GB memory and 4TB storage
Compact design under 1.5kg still delivers 1 PFLOPS of FP4 AI performance
Two linked systems scale to handle AI models with up to 405 billion parameters
Acer
has announced the
Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation
, a compact desktop built on Nvidia’s GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. It is designed to run large AI models locally, with the option to scale workloads further by linking two systems together. The Veriton GN100, revealed at IFA 2025 in Berlin, delivers up to 1 PFLOPS of FP4 AI performance through a combination of 20
Arm
-based CPU cores, CUDA cores and fifth-generation Tensor Cores. You may like

Up to 405 billion parameters
The device comes with 128GB of unified LPDDR5x memory and 4TB of self-encrypting NVMe storage. Despite its diminutive 150mm x 150mm footprint, and sub-1.5kg weight, the Veriton GN100 is intended to deliver server-class compute power in a
mini PC
form factor. The system includes
Nvidia
’s AI software stack and DGX Base OS, with support for commonly used developer tools such as PyTorch, Jupyter and Ollama.</div>

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl. Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets.</div>

OpenAI rolls out ChatGPT Projects to free users
The formerly paid feature acts as a folder system for organizing AI chats. Ian Carlos Campbell

OpenAI
has announced
that it&#x27;s making its Projects feature available to free users of ChatGPT. Projects let you organize chats with the company&#x27;s AI assistant around a specific subject, and were previously one of several privileges only enjoyed by paid subscribers. While on some level Projects are glorified folders for ChatGPT conversations, the ability to set custom instructions for how the AI responds or limit what information and files it can reference, makes the feature a useful option for power users. As part of this rollout, OpenAI is also increasing the number of files that can be added to a project for ChatGPT to reference. Free users can upload five, Plus subscribers can upload 25 and Pro subscribers can upload 40. Whether you pay for ChatGPT or not, you&#x27;ll also be able to customize the color and icon for your project, too. OpenAI has made a habit of slowly trickling down paid features to its free users over the last few years. Things like
Deep Research
and
ChatGPT Voice
started off as exclusives for the company&#x27;s subscribers before becoming available to everyone. Offering a formerly premium feature with limits is itself a way to get free customers to become paid ones. OpenAI&#x27;s decision to make the recently released
GPT-5 model
available to everyone at launch, but with harsher limits on how many times free users can use it follows a similar logic. Projects are available for free users on the web and in the ChatGPT app for Android. OpenAI says the iOS ChatGPT app will receive the feature &quot;over the coming days.&quot;
