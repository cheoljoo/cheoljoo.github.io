                <div class="summary">Gabriel Vasquez, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, recently revealed he took nine flights from NYC to Stockholm in one year. While his visits included stops at companies like Lovable — where he posted from its office — the trips were also about finding future Swedish unicorns before they cross the Atlantic. This all came to light when news emerged that a16z had led a $2.3 million pre-seed round into Dentio , a Swedish startup that uses AI to help dentists’ practices with admin work. While this is a small check for a firm that just announced new funds totaling $15 billion , it confirms that U.S. VCs are actively seeking deal flow outside of the U.S., even without local offices. Stockholm is a natural stop for a16z, which previously achieved significant returns from backing Skype, cofounded by Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennström. Since then, a significant number of fast-growing startups have been created in the Swedish capital, and the VC heavyweight tracked down where many of them were coming from. “We spend a lot of time developing a deep understanding of specific markets and knowing where innovation is emerging. In Sweden, that has meant closely tracking ecosystems like SSE Labs — the startup incubator of the Stockholm School of Economics — and the companies coming out of it,” Vasquez told TechCrunch. Like fintech giant Klarna, legal AI startup Legora, and e-scooter company Voi, Dentio is an alum of SSE Labs — a startup incubator that has produced several successful Swedish companies. The three former high school classmates Elias Afrasiabi, Anton Li and Lukas Sjögren joined the incubator after reconnecting as students at both the SSE (Stockholm School of Economics) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), then joined the incubator with additional backing from KTH’s Innovation Launch program . They tackled a problem close to home: Li’s mom, a dentist, had told them how admin work detracted from clinical care. The trio intuited that they could leverage LLMs to help</div>

                <div class="summary">Most ransomware playbooks don&#x27;t address machine credentials. Attackers know it. Louis Columbus February 16, 2026 The gap between ransomware threats and the defenses meant to stop them is getting worse, not better. Ivanti’s 2026 State of Cybersecurity Report found that the preparedness gap widened by an average of 10 points year over year across every threat category the firm tracks. Ransomware hit the widest spread: 63% of security professionals rate it a high or critical threat, but just 30% say they are “very prepared” to defend against it. That’s a 33-point gap, up from 29 points a year ago. CyberArk’s 2025 Identity Security Landscape puts numbers to the problem: 82 machine identities for every human in organizations worldwide. Forty-two percent of those machine identities have privileged or sensitive access. The most authoritative playbook framework has the same blind spot Gartner’s ransomware preparation guidance, the April 2024 research note “How to Prepare for Ransomware Attacks” that enterprise security teams reference when building incident response procedures, specifically calls out the need to reset “impacted user/host credentials” during containment. The accompanying Ransomware Playbook Toolkit walks teams through four phases: containment, analysis, remediation, and recovery. The credential reset step instructs teams to ensure all affected user and device accounts are reset. Service accounts are absent. So are API keys, tokens, and certificates. The most widely used playbook framework in enterprise security stops at human and device credentials. The organizations following it inherit that blind spot without realizing it. The same research note identifies the problem without connecting it to the solution. Gartner warns that “poor identity and access management (IAM) practices” remain a primary starting point for ransomware attacks, and that previously compromised credentials are being used to gain access through initial access brokers and dark web data du</div>

ByteDance backpedals after Seedance 2.0 turned Hollywood icons into AI “clip art” Hollywood backlash puts spotlight on ByteDance’s sketchy launch of Seedance 2.0. Ashley Belanger – Feb 16, 2026 12:42 pm | 30 Credit: Cheng Xin / Contributor | Getty Images News Credit: Cheng Xin / Contributor | Getty Images News Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav ByteDance says that it’s rushing to add safeguards to block Seedance 2.0 from generating iconic characters and deepfaking celebrities, after substantial Hollywood backlash after launching the latest version of its AI video tool. The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement. Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was “hijacking” its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were “free public domain clip art,” Axios reported . “ByteDance’s virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP is willful, pervasive, and totally unacceptable,” Disney’s letter said. Defending intellectual property from franchises like Star Trek and The Godfather , Paramount Skydance pointed out that Seedance’s outputs are “often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from the original characters, Variety reported . Similarly frustrated, Japan’s AI minister Kimi Onoda, sought to protect popular anime and manga characters, officially launching a probe last week into ByteDance over the copyright violations, the South China Morning Post reported . “We cannot overlook a situation in which content is being used without the copyright holder’s permission</div>

Apple is starting to test end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages with the developer beta of iOS 26.4 released Monday. Apple announced plans last year to support the feature, and once fully available, it will let iPhone and Android users send encrypted RCS messages to each other across platforms. However, with this initial implementation, Apple is only testing RCS encryption between Apple devices. It’s “not yet testable with other platforms,” Apple says. The company also doesn’t plan to ship E2EE RCS messages with iOS 26.4; the feature will actually ship publicly in a “future update,” Apple says.

                <div class="summary">India has 100 million weekly active ChatGPT users, making the country one of OpenAI’s largest markets globally, CEO Sam Altman said ahead of a government-hosted AI summit.
On Sunday, Altman outlined ChatGPT’s growing adoption in India in an article
published
in the Indian English daily Times of India, as OpenAI prepares to formally participate in the five-day India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, beginning Monday. Altman is
attending the event
alongside senior executives from several of the world’s leading AI companies.
The growth comes as OpenAI,
like other leading AI firms
, looks to India’s young population and its more than a billion internet users to fuel global expansion. The ChatGPT maker
opened a New Delhi office
in August 2025 after months of groundwork in the country, and has adjusted its approach for India’s price-sensitive market, including rolling out a
sub-$5 ChatGPT Go tier
that was
later made free for a year
for Indian users.
In the article, Altman said India is ChatGPT’s second-largest user base after the United States, highlighting the South Asian nation’s growing weight in OpenAI’s global strategy. The disclosure comes as ChatGPT’s overall usage has surged worldwide, with the platform
reaching 800 million weekly active users
as of October 2025 and reported to be
approaching 900 million
.
Altman also highlighted the role of students in driving adoption, saying India has the largest number of student users of ChatGPT globally.
Indian students have become a key growth segment for leading AI companies more broadly, as rivals race to embed their tools in classrooms and learning workflows. Google has similarly targeted the market, offering Indian students a
free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan
in September 2025. Separately, India accounts for the
highest global usage of Gemini for learning
, Chris Phillips, Google’s vice president and general manager for education, said last month.

Nvidia, Groq and the limestone race to real-time AI: Why enterprises win or lose here
Andrew Filev, Zencoder

​From miles away across the desert, the Great Pyramid looks like a perfect, smooth geometry — a sleek triangle pointing to the stars. Stand at the base, however, and the illusion of smoothness vanishes. You see massive, jagged blocks of limestone. It is not a slope; it is a staircase.
​Remember this the next time you hear futurists talking about exponential growth.
​Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore (Moore&#x27;s Law) is famously quoted for saying in 1965 that the transistor count on a microchip would double every year. Another Intel executive, David House, later revised this statement to “compute power doubling every 18 months.&quot; For a while, Intel’s CPUs were the poster child of this law. That is, until the growth in CPU performance flattened out like a block of limestone.
​If you zoom out, though, the next limestone block was already there — the growth in compute merely shifted from CPUs to the world of GPUs. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, played a long game and came out a strong winner, building his own stepping stones initially with gaming, then computer visioniand recently, generative AI.
​The illusion of smooth growth
​Technology growth is full of sprints and plateaus, and gen AI is not immune. The current wave is driven by transformer architecture. To quote Anthropic’s President and co-founder Dario Amodei: “The exponential continues until it doesn’t. And every year we’ve been like, ‘Well, this can’t possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential’ — and then every year it has.”
​But just as the CPU plateaued and GPUs took the lead, we are seeing signs that LLM growth is shifting paradigms again. For example, late in 2024, DeepSeek surprised the world by training a world-class model on an impossibly small budget, in part by using the MoE technique.

On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published an article containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.
That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.
Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.
We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.
