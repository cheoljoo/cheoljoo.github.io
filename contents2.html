                <div class="summary">Apple and Google have released several software updates to protect against a hacking campaign targeting an unknown number of their users. On Wednesday, Google
released patches
for a handful of security bugs in its Chrome browser, noting that one of the bugs was being actively exploited by hackers before the company had time to patch it. Unusually for Google, the company provided no further details at the time. But on Friday, Google updated the page to say that the bug was discovered by Apple’s security engineering team and Google’s Threat Analysis Group, whose security researchers primarily track government hackers and
mercenary spyware
makers, indicating that the hacking campaign may have been orchestrated by government-backed hackers. At the same time, Apple released security updates for its flagship products, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Vision Pro, Apple TV, Apple Watches, and its Safari browser. According to
the security advisory for iPhones and iPads
, Apple patched two bugs that the company said it was aware “that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” running devices prior to iOS 26. That language is Apple’s typical way of saying that it knows some of its customers and users were targeted by hackers exploiting
zero-days
, meaning flaws that at the time of exploitation are unknown to the software makers. Often, these are cases where government hackers used hacking tools and spyware made by companies such as
NSO Group
or
Paragon Solutions
to target journalists, dissidents, and human rights activists. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Update today.</div>

OpenAI has officially
released GPT-5.2
, and the reactions from early testers — among whom OpenAI seeded the model several days prior to public release, in some cases weeks ago — paints a two toned picture: it is a monumental leap forward for deep, autonomous reasoning and coding, yet potentially an underwhelming &quot;incremental&quot; update for casual conversationalists. Following early access periods and today&#x27;s broader rollout, executives, developers, and analysts have taken to X (formerly Twitter) and company blogs to share their first testing results. Here is a roundup of the first reactions to OpenAI’s latest flagship model. &quot;AI as a serious analyst&quot;
The strongest praise for GPT-5.2 centers on its ability to handle &quot;hard problems&quot; that require extended thinking time. Matt Shumer, CEO of HyperWriteAI, did not mince words in
his review
, calling GPT-5.2 Pro &quot;the best model in the world.&quot;
Shumer highlighted the model&#x27;s tenacity, noting that &quot;it thinks for **over an hour** on hard problems. And it nails tasks no other model can touch.&quot;
This sentiment was
echoed by Allie K. Miller
, an AI entrepreneur and former AWS executive. Miller described the model as a step toward &quot;AI as a serious analyst&quot; rather than a &quot;friendly companion.&quot;
&quot;The thinking and problem-solving feel noticeably stronger,&quot; Miller wrote on X. &quot;It gives much deeper explanations than I’m used to seeing. At one point it literally wrote code to improve its own OCR in the middle of a task.&quot;
Enterprise gains: Box reports distinct performance jumps
For the enterprise sector, the update appears to be even more significant. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, revealed on X
that his company has been testing GPT-5.2 in early access.</div>

Dozens of Ukrainian civilians filed a
series of lawsuits
in Texas this week, accusing some of the biggest US chip firms of negligently failing to track chips that evaded export curbs. Those chips were ultimately used to power Russian and Iranian weapon systems, causing wrongful deaths last year. Their complaints alleged that for years, Texas Instruments (TI), AMD, and Intel have ignored public reporting, government warnings, and shareholder pressure to do more to track final destinations of chips and shut down shady distribution channels diverting chips to sanctioned actors in Russia and Iran. Putting profits over human lives, tech firms continued using “high-risk” channels, Ukrainian civilians’ legal team alleged in a
press statement
, without ever strengthening controls. All that intermediaries who placed bulk online orders had to do to satisfy chip firms was check a box confirming that the shipment wouldn’t be sent to sanctioned countries, lead attorney Mikal Watts told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday,
according to the Kyiv Independent
. “There are export lists,” Watts said. “We know exactly what requires a license and what doesn’t. And companies know who they’re selling to.</div>

Compact footprint with good connectivity, LDAC and aptX
Automatic S/PDIF and ADAT detection and mode switching
$199 / €199 (about £175 / AU$400)
&quot;Topping releases a new DAC&quot; isn&#x27;t really news: it makes loads of them, from the ultra-affordable D10s to the G5 portable headphone DAC/amp and premium D90 III Sabre. But the new E50 II is interesting because it&#x27;s an impressive Hi-Res Audio DAC that crams a lot into its desktop-friendly footprint. It&#x27;s cheap, too: $199 / €199 (about £175 / AU$400). That means it undercuts many of the
best headphone DACs
and comes in at a similar price to the rather good
iFi ZEN DAC 3
, although the two devices have key differences: the iFi is also a headphone amp, but lacks the Bluetooth capabilities of the Topping. (Image credit: Topping)
Topping E50 II: key features
The Topping E50 II is built around AKM&#x27;s AK4497S DAC, and over USB it&#x27;s capable of linear PCM up to 32-bit/768kHz and DSD up to DSD512 (DoP DSD up to DSD256). You may like

Despite the compact size, there&#x27;s plenty of connectivity here with USB-C, coaxial and optical S/PDIF. RCA and balanced sockets take care of the outputs. The digital interface is based on the XMOS XU316 and the digital inputs support both S/PDIF and ADAT (the latter on the optical input).</div>
