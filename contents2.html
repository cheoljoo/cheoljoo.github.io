                <div class="summary">It’s only been since June that Meta invested
$14.3 billion
in the data-labeling vendor Scale AI, bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang and several of the startup’s top executives to run Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). But the relationship between the two companies is already showing signs of fraying.
At least one of the executives Wang brought over to help run MSL — Scale AI’s former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product and Operations, Ruben Mayer — has departed Meta after just two months with the company, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.
Mayer spent roughly five years with Scale AI across two stints. In his short time at Meta, according to those sources, Mayer oversaw AI data operations teams but wasn’t part of the company’s TBD Labs — the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence, where top AI researchers from OpenAI have landed.
However, Mayer disputes some details about his role, telling TechCrunch that his initial position was “to help set up the lab, with whatever was needed” rather than data, and that he was “part of TBD Labs from day one” rather than being excluded from the core AI unit. Mayer also clarified that he “did not report directly to [Wang]” and was “very happy” with his Meta experience.
Beyond the personnel changes, Meta’s relationship with Scale AI appears to be shifting. TBD Labs is working with third-party data labeling vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models, according to five people familiar with the matter. Those third-party vendors include Mercor and Surge, two of Scale AI’s largest competitors, the people said.
While AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors – Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up –  it’s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor.</div>

“With volatility now the norm, security and risk leaders need practical guidance on managing existing spending and new budgetary necessities,” states
Forrester’s 2026 Budget Planning Guide
, revealing a fundamental shift in how organizations allocate cybersecurity resources.
Software now commands
40%
of cybersecurity spending, exceeding hardware at
15.8%
, outsourcing at
15%
and surpassing personnel costs at
29%
by
11 percentage points
while organizations defend against gen AI attacks executing in milliseconds versus a Mean Time to Identify (MTTI) of
181 days
according to
IBM’s
latest
Cost of a Data Breach Report
.
Three converging threats are flipping cybersecurity on its head: what once protected organizations is now working against them. Generative AI (gen AI) is enabling attackers to craft 10,000 personalized phishing emails per minute using scraped LinkedIn profiles and corporate communications.
NIST’s 2030 quantum deadline
threatens retroactive decryption of
$425 billion
in currently protected data. Deepfake fraud that
surged 3,000% in 2024
now bypasses biometric authentication in
97%
of attempts, forcing security leaders to reimagine defensive architectures fundamentally.

Words have meaning. Proper word selection is integral to strong communication, whether it&#x27;s about relaying one’s feelings to another or explaining the terms of a deal, agreement, or transaction.
Language can be confusing, but typically when something is available to &quot;buy,&quot; ownership of that good or access to that service is offered in exchange for money. That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content.
Often, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking &quot;buy&quot; means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.
A lawsuit
[PDF]
recently filed against Prime Video challenges this practice and accuses the streaming service of misleading customers by labeling long-term rentals as purchases. The conclusion of the case could have implications for how streaming services frame digital content.
New lawsuit against Prime Video
On August 21, Lisa Reingold filed a proposed class-action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California against Amazon, alleging &quot;false and misleading advertising.&quot; The complaint, citing
Prime Video’s terms of use
, reads:
On its website, Defendant tells consumers the option to &#x27;buy&#x27; or &#x27;purchase&#x27; digital copies of these audiovisual works.</div>

Here’s how it works

Jeremy Irvine (Henry) and Hermione Corfield (Julia) in
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
.
(Image credit: Starz)
While it doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise, the drama has been fully kicking off in
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
. Without giving too much away, episode 5 of the
Starz
show followed Julia (Hermione Corfield) losing her carefully assembled allies after the spilling of secrets, Henry&#x27;s (Jeremy Irvine) little hope that he has left starting to slip away, and Ellen (Harriet Slater) and Brian (Jamie Roy) having a lovely time celebrating Beltane. Lucky for some.
We&#x27;ve still got no idea how, or if, the original
Outlander
cast are going to directly cross-over with
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
(though it is technically possible), and with another five episodes still to go, we can&#x27;t rule anything out. But when I had a chance to ask Irvine and Corfield exactly what that might be, surprises are coming much sooner than we first thought.
Next week&#x27;s episode 6 is going to be a particularly challenging one – both for us watching and when the cast initially filmed it.
Outlander: Blood of My Blood
fans should particularly keep an eye on on Julia, who&#x27;s about to have &quot;one of her biggest episodes.</div>

Libby is adding an AI book recommendation feature
Inspire Me recommends digital reading available at your local library.

Overdrive&#x27;s
digital book lending app Libby
is adding — you guessed it! — AI. The new Inspire Me feature is an AI-fueled discovery tool tuned to your local branch&#x27;s collection. Following a soft launch this month, it will be officially available in September.
To avoid
the pitfalls of a full-on chatbot
, Overdrive is limiting the discovery process of the feature. Instead of typing freely into a prompt box, you&#x27;ll start by answering several canned preference questions. These include categories (such as fiction and biography), age groups (adult or child) and preset adjectives (like &quot;clever&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;). You can also let it make recommendations based on your previously saved titles.
The AI will then spit out five suggestions from your local library. Overdrive
says
Inspire Me prioritizes ebooks and audiobooks that are immediately available. Each recommendation will include a brief explanation of how it aligns with your stated interests.

Some in the library community reacted sharply to the feature. &quot;Smoke is pouring out of my ears,&quot; librarian Rachel Storm
posted
on Bluesky (
via
TechCrunch
). &quot;I&#x27;m honestly surprised it took this long for them to enshittify Libby,&quot; Orion Kidder
responded
.
Libby&#x27;s AI privacy policy
states
that Inspire Me only sends tags connected to &quot;a random selection of titles you have saved&quot; to the model. The policy says it only sends the book titles, not any other details about you or your device. Overdrive says it designed the feature to minimize energy impact and will monitor its footprint over time.
As long as there isn&#x27;t anything sneaky tucked in beyond that, this sounds like a relatively tame (and potentially handy) use of AI.</div>

                <div class="summary">The Trump administration has structured a deal with Intel that includes a 10% equity stake for the U.S. government and aims to prevent Intel from selling its foundry business unit. The deal includes a five-year warrant allowing the government to acquire an additional 5% of Intel shares if the company&#x27;s equity in its foundry business falls below 51%. Intel&#x27;s CFO David Zinsner confirmed the government&#x27;s desire to prevent a spin-off or sale of the unit and noted that Intel received $5.7 billion in cash from the deal, stemming from grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The White House press secretary stated the deal is still being finalized. The article also mentions an upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 event.</div>

                <div class="summary">Research into the genetics of Central American mammoths reveals they formed a distinct genetic cluster, more closely related to each other than to other woolly or Columbian mammoths. This finding challenges previous understandings of Columbian mammoths, which were an enigma with some genetic data suggesting a steppe offshoot and others a woolly/steppe hybrid. Unlike most mammoth DNA studies that rely on samples from cold environments, this new data comes from bones found in the Basin of Mexico, a warmer region where DNA preservation is typically poor. The article highlights the diversity of mammoth species, including the Eurasian steppe, woolly, and North American Columbian mammoths, and how their genetic boundaries in North America appear to have been fluid.</div>
