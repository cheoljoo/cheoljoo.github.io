                <div class="summary">The Trump administration has structured a deal with Intel that includes a 10% equity stake for the U.S. government and aims to prevent Intel from selling its foundry business unit. The deal includes a five-year warrant allowing the government to acquire an additional 5% of Intel shares if the company&#x27;s equity in its foundry business falls below 51%. Intel&#x27;s CFO David Zinsner confirmed the government&#x27;s desire to prevent a spin-off or sale of the unit and noted that Intel received $5.7 billion in cash from the deal, stemming from grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The White House press secretary stated the deal is still being finalized. The article also mentions an upcoming TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 event.</div>

This model can follow complex instructions and generate natural, expressive voices, aiming to compete in the growing market for realistic and secure AI voices. It will be available on the Realtime API, alongside new voices named Cedar and Marin, and updated existing voices. OpenAI collaborated with customers building voice applications to train gpt-realtime, aligning it with real-world scenarios like customer support and academic tutoring. The company highlights the model&#x27;s capacity for emotive, natural-sounding voices and its speech-to-speech framework, which allows it to understand spoken prompts and respond vocally, making it suitable for real-time applications.</div>

                <div class="summary">Research into the genetics of Central American mammoths reveals they formed a distinct genetic cluster, more closely related to each other than to other woolly or Columbian mammoths. This finding challenges previous understandings of Columbian mammoths, which were an enigma with some genetic data suggesting a steppe offshoot and others a woolly/steppe hybrid. Unlike most mammoth DNA studies that rely on samples from cold environments, this new data comes from bones found in the Basin of Mexico, a warmer region where DNA preservation is typically poor. The article highlights the diversity of mammoth species, including the Eurasian steppe, woolly, and North American Columbian mammoths, and how their genetic boundaries in North America appear to have been fluid.</div>

                <div class="summary">Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, reported another quarter of sustained sales growth in its earnings statement Wednesday, with $46.7 billion in revenue, a 56% increase compared to the same period last year. That growth was largely fueled by AI-dominated data center business, which saw a 56% year-over-year increase in revenue.
Nvidia also saw its net income grow substantially since last year. The company reported a net income of $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a 59% spike since the same period last year.
All told, the company brought in $41.1 billion in revenue from data center sales in the quarter, suggesting that AI companies’ demand for cutting-edge GPUs continues to grow. The company’s most advanced generation of chips, Blackwell, accounted for $27 billion of those sales.
“Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for,” said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement accompanying the release. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.”
Huang said that the company expects to see $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade.
The company made particular note of its role in the launch of
OpenAI’s open source gpt-oss models
earlier this month, which involved processing “1.5 million tokens per second on a single Nvidia Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system.”
The earnings also gave a look at Nvidia’s ongoing struggle to sell its chips in Chinese markets. The company reported no sales of its China-focused H20 chip to Chinese customers in the past quarter; Nvidia did report $650 million worth of H20 chips had been sold to a customer outside China.

Salesforce
is betting that rigorous testing in simulated business environments will solve one of enterprise artificial intelligence’s biggest problems: agents that work in demonstrations but fail in the messy reality of corporate operations.
The cloud software giant unveiled three major AI research initiatives this week, including
CRMArena-Pro
, what it calls a “
digital twin
” of business operations where AI agents can be stress-tested before deployment. The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.
“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”
The research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent
MIT report
found that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.

Just weeks after being
confirmed by the Senate
, Susan Monarez has been ousted from the now thoroughly battered public health agency.
The news was first reported by
The Washington Post
, which cited multiple officials within the Trump administration. After Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services for confirmation of the ouster, HHS responded with a link to a post on the department&#x27;s X account. The post states:
Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.
The department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez&#x27;s ouster. But
reporting from The New York Times
suggests that she had clashed with US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F.</div>

Vacancy rates plummet as data centers struggle to match unprecedented demand
Northern Virginia dominates capacity while emerging markets grow at an explosive pace
Developers rush projects, yet 73% of new capacity is already preleased
Data centers are becoming the backbone of digital infrastructure, with vacancy rates in North America now at an all-time low of 2.3%, new JLL research has claimed.
Despite inventory reaching 15.5GW in mid-2025, the pace of absorption continues to outstrip available capacity.
This mismatch is fueled by surging reliance on AI, digital transformation, and
cloud storage
services, which have created a supply crunch across both established and emerging markets.

JLL claims North America could see as much as $1 trillion in new

development by 2030.
&quot;There was a significant increase in the amount of capital deployed into data center projects under construction or reaching stabilization in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year,” said Carl Beardsley, Senior Managing Director, Data Center Leader, JLL Capital Markets.
