Google and Microsoft-backed Terradot acquires carbon removal competitor
Carbon removal startup
Terradot
is acquiring competitor
Eion
, the two companies announced today. The sale was driven largely by big investors like sovereign wealth funds, which want to work with companies that can handle large contracts. Eion was simply too small, Eion CEO Anastasia Pavlovic Hans
told
The Wall Street Journal. Both companies spread pulverized rocks on farm fields to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Known as enhanced rock weathering (EWR), it speeds up a natural process and has the potential to be a
low-cost way to remove carbon
, but it requires large and distributed operations. The spread between what EWR companies would like to charge and what buyers would like to pay
remains wide
, according to a survey by CDR.fyi. California-based Terradot’s operations are centered on Brazil, where the company works with basalt as its mineral of choice, while Eion
works in the U.S. and uses olivine
. Terradot’s investor list includes Gigascale Capital, Google, Kleiner Perkins, and Microsoft, while Eion’s investors include AgFunder, Mercator Partners, and Overture. Topics

How recruitment fraud turned cloud IAM into a $2 billion attack surface
Louis Columbus
February 6, 2026
A developer gets a LinkedIn message from a recruiter. The role looks legitimate. The coding assessment requires installing a package. That package exfiltrates all cloud credentials from the developer’s machine — GitHub personal access tokens, AWS API keys, Azure service principals and more — are exfiltrated, and the adversary is inside the cloud environment within minutes. Your email security never saw it. Your dependency scanner might have flagged the package. Nobody was watching what happened next. The attack chain is quickly becoming known as the identity and access management (IAM) pivot, and it represents a fundamental gap in how enterprises monitor identity-based attacks. CrowdStrike Intelligence research
published on January 29 documents how adversary groups operationalized this attack chain at an industrial scale. Threat actors are cloaking the delivery of trojanized Python and npm packages through recruitment fraud, then pivoting from stolen developer credentials to full cloud IAM compromise. In one late-2024 case, attackers delivered malicious Python packages to a European FinTech company through recruitment-themed lures, pivoted to cloud IAM configurations and diverted cryptocurrency to adversary-controlled wallets. Entry to exit never touched the corporate email gateway, and there is no digital evidence to go on. On a recent episode of CrowdStrike’s
Adversary Universe podcast
, Adam Meyers, the company&#x27;s SVP of intelligence and head of counter adversary operations, described the scale: More than $2 billion associated with cryptocurrency operations run by one adversary unit. Decentralized currency, Meyers explained, is ideal because it allows attackers to avoid sanctions and detection simultaneously. CrowdStrike&#x27;s field CTO of the Americas, Crist...</div>

Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it. The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines? Around the same time, in the early 2010s, SpaceX was also trading the economics of reusing the second stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Eventually SpaceX founder Elon Musk abandoned his goal of a fully reusable Falcon 9, choosing instead to recover payload fairings and push down manufacturing costs of the upper stage as much as possible. This strategy worked, as SpaceX has lowered its internal launch costs of a Falcon 9, even with a new second stage, to about $15 million. The company is now focused on making the larger Starship rocket fully reusable. New Glenn is quite a bit larger than the Falcon 9 vehicle, 98 meters in height compared to 70 meters, and with a 7-meter diameter compared to the Falcon 9’s 3.7 meters; but it is also smaller than Starship. Accordingly Blue Origin has struggled with whether to reuse the New Glenn upper stage or to seek to ruthlessly cut its manufacturing costs. Ebbs and flows of the debate

, covering the second Trump administration, political influencers, tech lobbying and Big Tech vs. Big Government. 300 journalists have lost their jobs at
The Washington Post. Over 300,000 readers have canceled their subscriptions. Owner Jeff Bezos, who purchased the legendary publication in 2013, has driven his reputation into the ground by using his vast empire to churn out content designed to make President Donald Trump happy: Amazon MGM Studios spent $40 million to produce a fawning documentary about Melania Trump, which premiered days before the
Post
sent out mass layoff notices. And yet, he’s gotten nothing out of his attempts to suck up to Donald Trump — at least, nothing that’s a net positive to his bottom line
. Which begs the cynical question: Why does he even own
The
Washington Post
at all?...</div>

Disney+ loses access to Dolby Vision and HDR10+ in some European countries

Disney+ subscribers in some European countries have lost access to advanced HDR features like Dolby Vision and HDR10+,
TechRadar
and
FlatpanelsHD
report. The issue was first spotted by
German Disney+ subscribers on Reddit
, but currently also impacts subscribers in Portugal, Poland, France and the Netherlands, according to
FlatpanelsHD
. &quot;Dolby Vision support for content on Disney+ is currently unavailable in several European countries due to technical challenges,&quot; Disney said in a statement. &quot;We are actively working to restore access to Dolby Vision and will provide an update as soon as possible. 4K UHD and HDR support remain available on supported devices.&quot;
If the issue is in fact a technical one, it seems like it could be around for the long-term. Disney has removed any reference to Dolby Vision from its
Disney+ video quality support page in Germany
. As of now, the company lists HDR10 as its default HDR format, despite
Dolby Vision support
being a feature of Disney+ for several years now. Advertisement

FlatpanelsHD
writes that the real issue might be legal, rather than technological. A company called InterDigital
won an injunction in a German court
against Disney in November 2025 because it violated at least one of the company&#x27;s patents on streaming video technology.</div>

OpenAI launches new agentic coding model only minutes after Anthropic drops its own
On Monday,
OpenAI launched Codex
, an agentic coding tool marketed to software developers. Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex:
GPT-5.3 Codex
. The company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.”
OpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25 percent faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing. The new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a
new agentic coding model
released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models. Topics

OpenAI
on Wednesday released
GPT-5.3-Codex
, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade,
Claude Opus 4.6
. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market. The dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also
set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements
on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics. &quot;I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,&quot;
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X
minutes after the launch. He later added: &quot;It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.&quot;
That claim —
that the model helped build itself
— is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI&#x27;s announcement, the Codex team used early versions of
GPT-5.3-Codex
to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as &quot;our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.&quot;
OpenAI&#x27;s new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic&#x27;s Claude by double digits
The new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex

One of the weirdest corners of the Internet is suddenly hard to find on Bing, after the search engine inexplicably started blocking approximately 1.5 million independent websites hosted on Neocities. Founded in 2013 to archive the
“aesthetic awesomeness” of GeoCities websites
, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around
art
, niche
fandoms
, and special
expertise
—or simply seeking a place to
get a little weird online
—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted
visitors
discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling. That’s the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities’ founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first, the issue seemed resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn t...</div>

I&#x27;ve been critical of the
Nintendo Switch 2
in previous stories, given the price of its games and, to a lesser extent, the handheld&#x27;s price itself, but after giving it a shot, it&#x27;s a strong recommendation. You can now grab the
Nintendo Switch 2 bundle on Best Buy for $629.95 (was
$684.95
)
. The bundle includes
Mario Kart World
and
Donkey Kong Bananza
, two exclusive Switch 2 titles that showcase the fun ready to be had with the console this
President&#x27;s Day
. I&#x27;ve bought and played both games (not for $80), and I can say that they serve as perfect introductions to the Switch ecosystem, especially if you&#x27;ve not played many Nintendo games. While I still own my
Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS
