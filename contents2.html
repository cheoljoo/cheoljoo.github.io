ChatGPT’s voice mode is no longer a separate interface
ChatGPT’s voice mode is getting more usable. OpenAI
announced
on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode. That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text. You can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed. You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time. Rolling out to all users on mobile and web. Just update your app. pic.twitter.com/emXjNpn45w

November 25, 2025
Now, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time. The change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text. This revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps.</div>

                <div class="summary">What enterprises should know about The White House&#x27;s new AI &#x27;Manhattan Project&#x27; the Genesis Mission
Carl Franzen
November 25, 2025
VentureBeat made with Fal.ai using Google Imagen 4
President Donald Trump’s new “
Genesis Mission
” unveiled Monday, November 24, 2025, is billed as a generational leap in how the United States does science akin to the Manhattan Project that created the atomic bomb during World War II. The executive order
directs
the Department of Energy (DOE) to build a “closed-loop AI experimentation platform” that links the country’s 17 national laboratories, federal supercomputers, and decades of government scientific data into “one cooperative system for research.”
The White House fact sheet casts the initiative as a way to “transform how scientific research is conducted” and “accelerate the speed of scientific discovery,” with priorities spanning biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion, quantum information science, and semiconductors. DOE’s own release
calls it “the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built” and quotes Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil describing it as a “closed-loop system” linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into “an engine for discovery that doubles R&amp;D productivity.”
The
text of the order outlines mandatory steps DOE must complete within 60, 90, 120, 240, and 270 days—including identifying all Federal and partner compute resources, cataloging datasets and model assets, assessing robotic laboratory infrastructure across national labs, and demonstrating an initial operating capability for at least one scientific challenge within nine months. The
DOE’s own Genesis Mission website
adds important context: the initiative is launching with a broad coalition of private-sector, nonprofit, academic, and utility collaborators.</div>

An unpiloted Chinese spacecraft launched late Monday and linked up with the country’s Tiangong space station a few hours later, providing a lifeboat for three astronauts stuck in orbit without a safe ride home. A Long March 2F rocket fired its engines and lifted off with the Shenzhou 22 spacecraft, carrying cargo instead of a crew, at 11:11 pm EST Monday (04:11 UTC Tuesday). The spacecraft docked with the Tiangong station nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers) above the Earth about three-and-a-half hours later. Chinese engineers worked fast to move up the launch of the Shenzhou 22, originally set to fly next year. On November 5
, officials discovered one of the two crew ferry ships docked to the Tiangong station had a cracked window, likely from an impact with a small fragment of space junk. Officials made the discovery during a crew handover on the station, a few days after the arrival of a fresh three-person crew and just before the departure of three astronauts who had been in orbit since April. After engineers deemed the damaged Shenzhou 20 ship unsafe, Chinese space officials decided to send the outgoing crew back to Earth on the unblemished Shenzhou 21 spacecraft.</div>

Black Friday deals
like this one are called doorbusters, because if this were a physical shop you&#x27;d be busting down the door to buy two pairs. It&#x27;s an exceptional offer on
Apple
&#x27;s cheapest earbuds, and who knows how long it&#x27;ll last at this price – every time we&#x27;ve seen previous models of AirPods fall this low, they sold out pretty quick. (Not in the US? See today&#x27;s best deals in your region below)

In our
AirPods 4 review
we said they were overpriced at $129: better rivals were cheaper. But this Black Friday deal changes the game because it&#x27;s such a big price cut. And that means there&#x27;s now another big reason to go with Apple&#x27;s option rather than a rival brand. As we&#x27;ve said before, all the best features of the AirPods 4 are Apple-specific: head-tracking spatial audio, auto-device switching, Find My support, audio sharing, and so on. With these earbuds those features work perfectly and reliably.</div>

Games Done Quick has wrapped up
its 2025 events
, but a new year of speedrunning for charity is on the horizon. The organization released the schedule for Back to Black 2026 on Tuesday. You can watch the action from February 5 to 8. As its name suggests, the event celebrates the Black community through the joy of gaming. Organized by Black in a Flash, the event will showcase all-Black speed runs of titles ranging from popular to obscure. There are plenty of fun runs on
the schedule
. Someone will take on
Hades II
, one of the
best games of 2025
. Then there&#x27;s
Cuphead
, an excruciatingly difficult title even when you have all the time in the world. The schedule has some retro games, like
Donkey Kong Country
,
Street Fighter 2
and
Sonic Heroes
. You&#x27;ll also find some little-known ones, like the 1996 Sega Saturn weirdfest,
Mr. Bones
. This year&#x27;s shindig will support
Race Forward
, a nonprofit working toward racial equity. Last year&#x27;s Back to Black event raised $44,000 for the same charity. Advertisement

                <div class="summary">There’s a new AI-powered toy for kids called
Stickerbox
, and, before you groan, I’m here to report that it’s surprisingly fun.
Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup
Hapiko
, is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere.
Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similiar: “
An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own
.”
After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.
Stickerbox
, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think.

Testing the AI sticker printer
The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.
The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that the Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model.
Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.
To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network.</div>

Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 is here: Cheaper AI, infinite chats, and coding skills that beat humans

Anthropic
released its most capable artificial intelligence model yet on Monday, slashing prices by roughly two-thirds while claiming state-of-the-art performance on software engineering tasks — a strategic move that intensifies the AI startup&#x27;s competition with deep-pocketed rivals OpenAI and Google.
The new model,
Claude Opus 4.5
, scored higher on Anthropic&#x27;s most challenging internal engineering assessment than any human job candidate in the company&#x27;s history, according to materials reviewed by VentureBeat. The result underscores both the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI systems and growing questions about how the technology will reshape white-collar professions.
The Amazon-backed company is pricing Claude Opus 4.5 at
$5 per million input tokens
and
$25 per million output tokens
— a dramatic reduction from the $15 and $75 rates for its predecessor,
Claude Opus 4.1
, released earlier this year. The move makes frontier AI capabilities accessible to a broader swath of developers and enterprises while putting pressure on competitors to match both performance and pricing.
&quot;We want to make sure this really works for people who want to work with these models,&quot; said Alex Albert, Anthropic&#x27;s head of developer relations, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;That is really our focus: How can we enable Claude to be better at helping you do the things that you don&#x27;t necessarily want to do in your job?&quot;
The announcement comes as Anthropic races to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field. OpenAI recently released
GPT-5.1
and a specialized coding model called
Codex Max
that can work autonomously for extended periods.</div>

The US space agency ended months of speculation about the next flight of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, confirming Monday that the vehicle will carry only cargo to the International Space Station.
NASA and Boeing are now targeting no earlier than April 2026 to fly the uncrewed Starliner-1 mission, the space agency said. Launching by next April will require completion of rigorous test, certification, and mission readiness activities, NASA added
in a statement
.
“NASA and Boeing are continuing to rigorously test the Starliner propulsion system in preparation for two potential flights next year,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in a statement.
Reducing crewed missions
NASA also said it has reached an agreement with Boeing to modify the Commercial Crew contract, signed in 2014, that called for six crewed flights to the space station following certification of the spacecraft. Now the plan is to fly Starliner-1 carrying cargo, and then up to three additional missions before the space station is retired.
“This modification allows NASA and Boeing to focus on safely certifying the system in 2026, execute Starliner’s first crew rotation when ready, and align our ongoing flight planning for future Starliner missions based on station’s operational needs through 2030,” Stich said.</div>

Black Friday
is nearly here and HP’s deals are now live, making this a great moment to pick up a new laptop for home,
work
or
study
, without blowing the budget.
If you want a big display at a small price, the 17.3 inch FHD models are strong picks.
One runs an AMD Ryzen 5
with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, while
another version
steps up to a 13th Gen Intel Core i5, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD.
Creatives (and gamers) should look at the
Victus 15
. It has a fast 144Hz screen, an AMD Ryzen 7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 4050 GPU. It offers more than enough power for heavier creative workloads.
If you want the latest AI focused hardware, take a look at HP’s Copilot+ PCs. The
OmniBook 5
is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip, has an OLED display and long battery life. The larger
OmniBook X
moves to an Intel Core Ultra processor, Intel Arc graphics, a 17.3 inch touchscreen.
There are also solid mid range choices. The
HP 15.6 inch touch model
with an Intel Core i5 and 16GB of RAM is a dependable option for work or school. The
16 inch OmniBook 5
has an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a bright WUXGA screen.
Finally, if it&#x27;s versatility you&#x27;re after, the
OmniBook Ultra Flip
has a sharp 3K OLED touchscreen and a flexible design that works just as well for writing as it does for streaming.
Whatever you’re looking for, HP’s Black Friday lineup has plenty of value across sizes, processors, and features.
