                <div class="summary">Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of packages and car thefts.
The popular internet-connected security camera maker
said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems
to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.
“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.
“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.”
Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”
This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.
Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon,
a viral calling app
that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls,
had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data
. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.
Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI
Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.
The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.</div>

On Tuesday, OpenAI
announced
Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls &quot;cameos.&quot;
OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.
Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls &quot;sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.&quot; In May, Google&#x27;s
Veo 3
became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released
Wan 2.5
, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.
OpenAI demonstrates Sora 2&#x27;s capabilities in a launch video.
The model also features notable visual consistency improvements over OpenAI&#x27;s previous video model, and it can also follow more complex instructions across multiple shots while maintaining coherency between them.</div>

Euclyd CRAFTWERK SiP claims bandwidth levels far beyond Nvidia’s designs
The rack-scale system is said to reach over one exaflop performance
Power efficiency claims suggest massive gains, though independent testing is missing
European startup Euclyd has announced new hardware aimed at large-scale AI inference.
The system, called CRAFTWERK, was introduced at the KISACO Infrastructure Summit 2025 in Santa Clara.
The
company
describes it as designed specifically for agentic AI workloads, with specifications that set it apart from current accelerators.

Acer joins Nvidia GB10 superchip fan club with $3,999 Veriton AI mini workstation PC - and yes, you can link two to get even more power
&#x27;Enfabrica has the coolest technology&#x27;: Nvidia spent nearly $1 billion on a chip maker to secure its future on the same day it gave Intel $5 billion - and here&#x27;s why this is actually a more important investment
Inside the CRAFTWERK architecture
At the core of the release is the CRAFTWERK SiP, a system-in-package that fits into the palm of a hand.
It integrates 16,384 custom SIMD
processors
alongside 1TB of custom ultra-bandwidth memory, or UBM.
Euclyd claims this memory can deliver 8,000 terabytes per second of bandwidth.
The compute performance is listed at up to 8 petaflops in FP16 and 32 petaflops in FP4 precision.</div>

President Donald Trump is launching a new government-run website that he says will let Americans buy medications at lower prices. The new website, called TrumpRx, is expected to launch in 2026 and will direct consumers to discounts on drugmakers’ online stores, including Pfizer’s, as reported earlier
by
The New York Times
and
NPR
.
The Tuesday announcement comes as part of a deal that grants Pfizer a three-year reprieve from tariffs in exchange for investing in US-based manufacturing, according to the
company’s press release
. Pfizer also agreed to lower prices on the “majority” of the primary care drugs sold through state Medicaid programs, which it says could result in an average savings of 50 percent.

Ubisoft has launched — and named — its Tencent-backed subsidiary. Vantage Studios is the first of the company&#x27;s &quot;creative houses&quot; under a previously-announced reorganization. The new studio will oversee the company&#x27;s tentpole franchises: Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.
The news follows Ubisoft&#x27;s
March announcement of a new subsidiary
with a €1.16 billion ($1.36 billion) investment from Tencent. The Chinese company took a minority ownership stake in Vantage as part of the deal. In July, Ubisoft
named
the new subsidiary&#x27;s co-CEOs: Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot.
&quot;Our focus is on evolving Ubisoft&#x27;s operating model to bring more focus, more autonomy and more accountability to the teams so they can stay closely attuned to our players,&quot; Guillemot said at the time. &quot;Decision making will be quicker, and it will also be easier to pivot when we need to change course.&quot;
Ubisoft
Ubisoft&#x27;s
announcement
today reflected that language. The idea is to give its developers &quot;a higher level of autonomy&quot; at Vantage and future studios. It wants the new structure to enable &quot;a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback.&quot;

Vantage is the only creative house the parent company has announced. The company will set up future ones &quot;under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise.&quot; However, it&#x27;s unclear what other creative houses will work on, with Vantage taking over Ubisoft&#x27;s bread-and-butter franchises.
Vantage&#x27;s team will be spread across Ubisoft&#x27;s offices in Montréal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona and Sofia. Multiple gaming publications, including

                <div class="summary">Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has blocked an effort to pass legislation that would have extended data privacy protections for federal lawmakers and public officials to everyone in the United States.
On Monday night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the U.S. Senate for unanimous consent from fellow senators to pass his legislation,
S.2850
. Wyden’s bill, if passed, would have taken
bipartisan-passed provisions
designed to protect government officials, lawmakers, and their families from having their personal information sold or traded by data brokers, and extend them to every American and person living in the United States.
“Members of Congress should not receive special treatment,” Wyden said on the Senate floor. “Our constituents deserve protection from violence, stalking, and other criminal threats.”
“Protecting everyone is the most effective way to protect U.S. military and intelligence personnel, including undercover officers,” Wyden added, per
the congressional record
.
Cruz was the sole objecting senator, who claimed without evidence that Wyden’s bill could disrupt law enforcement, “such as knowing where sexual predators are living.”
Data brokers are part of a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from hoarding and selling access to huge amounts of Americans’ personal, financial, and granular location information, often collected from phones and other devices connected to the internet. This data gets sold,
including to governments
, who don’t need a warrant for commercially obtainable data.
The collection of huge banks of data also comes with its own risks, including
security lapses
and
data breaches
. Information bought by data brokers has been used to dox people, and in recent cases linked to the recent murders of two Minnesota state lawmakers, whose killer
allegedly obtained their home addresses
from data brokers.</div>

Fresh off his crusade against Jimmy Kimmel and ABC, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission may eliminate TV station ownership limits in a potential gift for station owners like Sinclair and Nexstar.
When FCC Chairman Brendan Carr
threatened ABC affiliates with license revocations
for carrying Jimmy Kimmel&#x27;s show, he said that national networks exert too much control over local TV stations and that he&#x27;s trying &quot;to empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.&quot; Taking a cue from Carr, Sinclair and Nexstar continued blocking
Jimmy Kimmel Live!
on their ABC affiliates even after ABC and its owner Disney ended Kimmel&#x27;s suspension.
Within days, Sinclair and Nexstar decided to
put Kimmel back on the air
. Pressure from viewers and advertisers likely played a major role in the reversal. But for Carr, the episode might reinforce his belief that station groups should have more influence over national programming.
Today, Carr&#x27;s FCC
voted
to seek public comment on a
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) that could result in certain broadcast ownership limits being scrapped or changed.</div>

Baseus makes a surprising but welcome entry to dash cams

Here’s how it works

The Baseus PrimeTrip VD1 Pro has a tiny solar panel that powers recording while you&#x27;re parked
There&#x27;s also a battery for continuous, on-the-road recording
Complete with front 4K and rear 1080p cameras
I look after TechRadar&#x27;s dash cam coverage and have reviewed plenty of the
best dash cams
from the likes of Nextbase and
Garmin
. Thankfully, there&#x27;s still room for innovation in this space, as this week I came across the surprising Baseus PrimeTrip VD1 Pro.
The VD1 Pro has a unique trick up its sleeve: a tiny solar panel. Let&#x27;s be clear, it&#x27;s not enough to power the dash cam for continuous, on-the-road recording – there&#x27;s an internal battery for that. No, what the solar panel can do is power a parking mode for up to two weeks.
Parking modes are a relatively recent thing in dash cams. They spark to life to record the evidence when motion and threats around your parked vehicle are detected, like bumps or break-ins. Typically, they&#x27;re powered
by hardwiring to your vehicle&#x27;s battery
.

I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.
E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.
Editor&#x27;s note (September 2025):
Amazon announced a revamped family of
Kindle Scribe E Ink tablets
. The
Kindle Scribe 3
is thinner and lighter than its predecessor with faster page-turning and writing experiences. The
Kindle Scribe Colorsoft
is the first full-color addition to the lineup, with a pen that will support writing in 10 colors and highlighting in five different shades. Both new Scribe tablets will be available in the US &quot;later this year.</div>
