                <div class="summary">A decade ago, two college students built a fire extinguisher that
snuffed out a fire
using nothing more than a booming 10-inch subwoofer. The internet lapped it up, and Jimmy Fallon even booked a demonstration for
The Tonight Show
.
But since that brief viral moment, there hasn’t been much more than a whisper about the technology.
It’s not for lack of trying. The college kids weren’t the first to prove the concept. DARPA was on the case
in 2012
; and a search of the scientific literature reveals dozens of researchers investigating the idea.
One startup now claims to have cracked the problem.
Sonic Fire Tech
has built an acoustic fire suppression system that doesn’t just extinguish flames; it that might also protect homes and other buildings from wildfires. The startup has raised a $3.5 million seed round from investors, including Khosla Ventures and Third Sphere, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.
Wildfires cost the U.S. as much as
$424 billion annually
. The problem has become
so acute
in places like California that insurers are
refusing to renew policies
after repeated blazes have reduced large swathes of the state to ashes.
Sonic Fire Tech has been developing its technology over the last several years. Michael Thomas, who is chairman of the startup’s board, had been tinkering with the idea of using sound to fight fires, and when he hit a wall, he reached out to Geoff Bruder over LinkedIn. Bruder had worked for NASA, where he focused on heat and acoustics.
“This is kind of a new age founding story,” Bruder, the startup’s CEO and CTO, told TechCrunch.

Visa just launched a protocol to secure the AI shopping boom — here’s what it means for merchants
Michael Nuñez
October 14, 2025
Visa
is introducing a new security framework designed to solve one of the thorniest problems emerging in artificial intelligence-powered commerce: how retailers can tell the difference between legitimate AI shopping assistants and the malicious bots that plague their websites.
The payments giant unveiled its
Trusted Agent Protocol
on Tuesday, establishing what it describes as foundational infrastructure for &quot;agentic commerce&quot; — a term for the rapidly growing practice of consumers delegating shopping tasks to AI agents that can search products, compare prices, and complete purchases autonomously.
The protocol enables merchants to cryptographically verify that an AI agent browsing their site is authorized and trustworthy, rather than a bot designed to scrape pricing data, test stolen credit cards, or carry out other fraudulent activities.
The launch comes as AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail websites has
exploded by more than 4,700%
over the past year, according to data from Adobe cited by Visa. That dramatic surge has created an acute challenge for merchants whose existing bot detection systems — designed to block automated traffic — now risk accidentally blocking legitimate AI shoppers along with bad actors.
&quot;Merchants need additional tools that provide them with greater insight and transparency into agentic commerce activities to ensure they can participate safely,&quot; said Rubail Birwadker, Visa&#x27;s Global Head of Growth, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Without common standards, potential risks include ecosystem fragmentation and the proliferation of closed loop models.&quot;
The stakes are substantial. While 85% of shoppers who have used AI to shop report improved experiences, merchants face the prospect of either turning away legitimate AI-powered customers or exposing themselves to sophisticated bot attacks.</div>

As if DirecTV doesn&#x27;t have enough trouble keeping customers, the satellite TV provider&#x27;s streaming devices will show AI-generated screensaver ads next year, according to an announcement today from partnering ads company Glance.
People who use either of DirecTV’s two Gemini streaming devices will start seeing the ads “in early 2026,” per the announcement. DirecTV’s Gemini Air is an Android TV-powered USB device that people can plug into a TV for access to live TV channels, as well as streaming apps. Gemini Air doesn’t require a DirecTV satellite connection, and DirecTV gives all of its Internet customers the device. DirecTV first started selling Gemini devices
in 2023
, when it launched a separate Gemini set-top box that connects through DirecTV satellite setups.
DirecTV made an agreement with Glance to show AI-generated content and ads on Gemini devices&#x27; screensavers. Currently, Gemini devices show Google wallpapers as screensavers, which are on by default. When the new screensavers launch, Glance&#x27;s AI content will show if the TV is idle for 10 minutes,
The Verge
reported.
For the unfamiliar, Glance is the same company that brought
AI-generated lock screen ads with users’ faces
to Samsung Galaxy phones in June. The Indian company recently started
pushing
its ad platform to
smart TV operating systems, as well

OneOdio Focus A6: two-minute review
Let me cut right to the chase: the OneOdio Focus A6 are the
best budget headphones
I’ve ever used. Loud, bassy, attractively designed and sporting sturdy software support, they offer everything you could reasonably ask for from a pair of sub-$100 cans. And then some.
Just how much have OneOdio’s affordable (but definitely not cheap-feeling) over-ears impressed me over the course of a month&#x27;s testing? I have such a high opinion of them, I’ve actively chosen to use these cans in my free time over my
Apple
AirPods Max. And for context, Crew Cupertino’s high-end headphones normally retail for over five times what OneOdio is currently asking for the Focus A6s – and yes, both models can do USB-C wired Lossless audio.
There’s so much to like here and, well… hear. I can honestly say the Focus A6s are comfortably the best headphones I’ve ever reviewed that clock in at well under $100 / $100.</div>

Google reportedly offers to tweak search results to avoid EU fine
The company could be fined $35 billion or more for violating the Digital Markets Act.

In order to avoid paying billions of dollars in fines for violating the European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act, Google is considering changing how search results are displayed,
Reuters
reports
. EU regulators
first took issue
with Google&#x27;s Search and Play Store businesses in March 2025, claiming it favored its own services in search results over third-party options and prevented developers from informing customers of alternative ways of accessing apps.
One of regulators main issues with Google Search was that Google appeared to favor results from services like Google Flights or Google Hotels over ones from &quot;vertical search services,&quot; providers that specialize in displaying search results from a specific industry, like Expedia or Hotels.com. To avoid fines, Google now wants Search to give VSS businesses equal treatment in results.
&quot;We will create the opportunity for each VSS to show its own box on Search. A VSS box will be populated with results from that VSS inventory,&quot; Google said in a proposal viewed by
Reuters
. Results from Google&#x27;s own services will exist with the same formatting alongside, and the winning VSS box will be displayed in search results based on &quot;objective and non-discriminatory criteria.&quot; Importantly, search results from actual airlines and car rental companies won&#x27;t be excluded, they&#x27;ll also appear in a box &quot;above or below the VSS box depending on the relevance to the user&#x27;s query.&quot;

                <div class="summary">This new AI technique creates ‘digital twin’ consumers, and it could kill the traditional survey industry
Michael Nuñez
October 13, 2025
A new
research paper
quietly published last week outlines a breakthrough method that allows large language models (LLMs) to simulate human consumer behavior with startling accuracy, a development that could reshape the multi-billion-dollar
market research industry
. The technique promises to create armies of synthetic consumers who can provide not just realistic product ratings, but also the qualitative reasoning behind them, at a scale and speed currently unattainable.
For years, companies have sought to use AI for market research, but have been stymied by a fundamental flaw: when asked to provide a numerical rating on a scale of 1 to 5, LLMs produce unrealistic and poorly distributed responses. A new paper, &quot;
LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings
,&quot; submitted to the pre-print server arXiv on October 9th proposes an elegant solution that sidesteps this problem entirely.
The international team of researchers, led by Benjamin F. Maier, developed a method they call
semantic similarity rating (SSR)
. Instead of asking an LLM for a number, SSR prompts the model for a rich, textual opinion on a product. This text is then converted into a numerical vector — an &quot;embedding&quot; — and its similarity is measured against a set of pre-defined reference statements. For example, a response of &quot;I would absolutely buy this, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for&quot; would be semantically closer to the reference statement for a &quot;5&quot; rating than to the statement for a &quot;1.&quot;
The results are striking. Tested against a massive real-world dataset from a leading personal care corporation — comprising 57 product surveys and 9,300 human responses — the SSR method achieved 90% of human test-retest reliability.</div>

Google began
experimenting with conversational image editing
earlier this year in the dev-focused AI studio, but the feature didn&#x27;t remain experimental for long. Over the summer, Google rolled out the &quot;
Nano Banana
&quot; image-editing model in Gemini 2.5 Flash. You can use this feature to modify images with just a prompt, and now you don&#x27;t even need to go to Gemini to use it. Google says Nano Banana is now coming to search, Google Photos, and NotebookLM.
The AI image editor is coming to search via Lens and AI Mode. For Lens, you can simply open the app (iOS and Android) and snap a photo to get started. When the rollout is complete, you&#x27;ll see a &quot;Create&quot; button at the bottom, with a banana icon. Tap that to enter a prompt, telling the AI how you&#x27;d like the photo changed.
When you begin an edit in Lens, the Google app will display the results and offer the chance for follow-up edits in the AI Mode interface. Google is
always looking
for more ways to get people plugged into its conversational search bot, so there&#x27;s also a separate way to access Nano Banana there. Simply select the &quot;Create image&quot; tool and enter your prompt to create an image. You can then continue the conversation to have Nano Banana change the image.
NotebookLM added a video overview feature several months back, which uses AI to generate a video summary of the content you&#x27;ve added to the notebook. The addition of Nano Banana to NotebookLM is much less open-ended.</div>

Tron: Ares
was released in cinemas on October 10 and will eventually be available to stream on Disney+.

After years of development,
Tron: Ares
is finally out of the Grid and onto the screen, bringing a new sci-fi story about the fictional cyberspace that reflects on today&#x27;s technological headlines.
While critics have slammed the new movie&#x27;s obvious plot and bland characters, the mid-credit scene strongly hints at another sequel (more on that later). But will Tron 4 go ahead following the latest film&#x27;s ropey start?
According to director Joachim Rønning, “it always depends on how many people want to see it.” Here’s what Rønning, along with
Tron: Ares
producers, told me about the likelihood of another installment, and where the Tron universe could go next.

Ads in Google search results
are getting a more prominent label
, and a way to hide them if you’re not interested. Handy! The thing is, you still have to look at them first.
Currently, Google labels paid results on search pages individually with a “sponsored” tag on each one. This change groups them all into a collapsable section at the top of the page with a single, larger label that remains in view as you scroll. At the
bottom
of the section you’ll see a button to hide sponsored results, so you’ll have to scroll by them first. Tap the button to hide them and they’ll remain collapsed under that sponsored heading; tapping again to show sponsored results unfurls them. Google says the update is rolling out now on both desktop and mobile.
Previously, each paid result got its own sponsored label.</div>
