                <div class="summary">ChatGPT’s growth is starting to taper off, according to new data from market intelligence firm
Sensor Tower
. Today, the OpenAI-owned AI chatbot remains the leader in the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the global monthly active users. However, Google’s Gemini has begun to outpace ChatGPT in terms of download growth, growth of monthly active users, and growth of time spent in app, the firm found.
Over time, that increased pace of adoption could help Gemini narrow the gap with ChatGPT. That’s something OpenAI is now worried about, as its recent
“code red” memo
indicated. The missive, penned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, instructed staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and more.
When looking at the recent data, it’s clear the race is not over yet: both ChatGPT and Gemini continue to see sizable growth.
ChatGPT has seen its global monthly active users climb by 180% year-over-year as of November 2025, while Gemini’s monthly active users are up 170%.

But the new data indicates that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew by around 6% from August to November, to reach roughly 810 million. (The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says.
Meanwhile, Google’s Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption.
In addition, the report noted that around 2 times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mo...</div>

AI denial is becoming an enterprise risk: Why dismissing “slop” obscures real capability gains
Louis Rosenberg, Unanimous A.I.
December 5, 2025
Rosenberg/ChatGPT
Three years ago, ChatGPT was born. It amazed the world and ignited unprecedented investment and excitement in AI. Today, ChatGPT is still a toddler, but public sentiment around the AI boom has turned sharply negative. The shift began when OpenAI released GPT-5 this summer
to mixed reviews
, mostly from casual users who, unsurprisingly, judged the system by its surface flaws rather than its underlying capabilities.
Since then, pundits and influencers have declared that AI progress is slowing, that scaling has “hit the wall,” and that the entire field is just another tech bubble inflated by blusterous hype. In fact, many influencers have latched onto the dismissive phrase “AI slop” to diminish the amazing images, documents, videos and code that frontier AI models generate on command.
This perspective is not just wrong, it is dangerous.
It makes me wonder, where were all these “experts” on irrational technology bubbles when electric scooter startups were touted as a transportation revolution and cartoon NFTs were being auctioned for millions? They were probably too busy buying
worthless land in the metaverse
or adding to their positions in GameStop. But when it comes to the AI boom, which is easily the most significant technological and economic transformation agent of the last 25 years, journalists and influencers can’t write the word “slop” enough times.
Doth we protest too much?
After all, by any objective measure AI is wildly more capable than the vast majority of
computer scientists predicted only five years ago
and it is still improving at a surprising pace. The impressive leap demonstrated by Gemini 3 is only the latest example. At the same time, McKinsey recently reported that 20% of organizations already derive tangible value from genAI. Also, a
recent survey
by Deloitte indicates that 85% of...</div>

The bidding war is over, and Netflix has been declared the winner.
After flirting with
Paramount Skydance
and Comcast, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has decided to sell its streaming and movie studios business to Netflix. If approved, the deal is set to overturn the media landscape and create ripples that will affect Hollywood for years.
$72 billion acquisition
Netflix will pay an equity value of $72 billion, or an approximate total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, for Warner Bros. All of WBD has a $60 billion market value,
NBC News
notes.
The acquisition will take place after WBD completes the
split of its streaming and studios businesses
, which includes its film and TV libraries and the HBO channel, and its other TV networks, including CNN and TBS, into separate companies (Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, respectively). WBD’s split is expected to finish in Q3 2026.
Additionally, Netflix’s acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals, WBD shareholder approval, and other “customary closing conditions.”
Netflix expects the purchase to net it more subscribers, higher engagement, and “at least $2–3 billion of cost savings per year by the third year,” its announcement said.
Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said in a statement that Netflix will use its global reach and business model to bring WB content to “a broader audience.”
The announcement didn’t specify what this means for current WBD staff, including WBD’s current president and CEO, David Zaslav. Gunnar Wiedenfels, who is currently CFO of WBD, is
expected to be

Europol dismantled a $700M crypto laundering network
Raids in Cyprus, Germany, and Spain seized $1.7M in assets and arrested nine
Scammers used fraudulent platforms, pressure tactics, and deepfake celebrity ads to lure thousands of victims
Europol and multiple national law enforcement agencies
recently took down a cryptocurrency
and money laundering network worth more than 700 million. The network extended to multiple countries, and spanned fake exchange platforms, fake customer support centers, and fake affiliate marketing infrastructure.
The takedown resulted in more than a million dollars in seized assets, and the arrest of nine suspects.
“What began as an investigation into a single fraudulent cryptocurrency platform gradually unfolded into a complex, far-reaching operation, revealing a vast network of deceit and money laundering,” Europol said.

Pantone’s color of the year for 2026 is white — sorry, Cloud Dancer. Pantone announced the shade on Thursday, and describes it as a “discrete white hue offering a promise of clarity.” The

“PANTONE 11-4201 Cloud Dancer encourages true relaxation and focus, allowing the mind to wander and creativity to breathe, making room for innovation,” the company writes. But all I can see is a recession indicator.

This is the third year in a row where the Pantone color has slid more and more into unobtrusive, dispassionate shades: in 2024 we had Peach Fuzz,
in 2025 it was Mocha Mousse
, and now we have moved beyond the neutrals into nothingness. The color of the year is above all a ma...</div>

Liquid Swords
The debut game from Liquid Swords will arrive in early 2026, it was announced at today&#x27;s PC Gaming Show.
Samson: A Tyndalston Story
is billed as &quot;a consequence-heavy noir action game&quot; by its developer, and focuses on the eponymous Samson McCray, a man who&#x27;s got himself into serious debt in a city that doesn’t seem particularly forgiving.
The debut trailer doesn’t give too much away in terms of story, but I’m getting gritty Max Payne-y vibes. Combat looks crunchy and visceral, and it sounds like Liquid Swords is going for an oppressive atmosphere. &quot;Samson is built on a simple, brutal truth: every day costs you,&quot; writes the studio in a press release. &quot;Debt grows with interest, and time works against you. Each job burns a limited pool of Action Points and every decision shifts how the city treats you—there are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.&quot;
Liquid Swords has been
teasing
its first game for a while. The studio has some serious pedigree, being founded in 2020 by Christofer Sundberg, who created the Just Cause franchise when he was at Avalanche Studios. Developers who previously worked on
Mad Max
and the Battlefield series have also joined Sundberg at Liquid Swords, and the studio says it drew on its collective experience in combat systems, systemic design, animation and action-oriented storytelling to create
Samson
.

Just Cause was an open-world series, but it sounds like
Samson
will be a more focused experience, possibly reflected by its $25 price tag. At the beginning of the year, the studio
laid off
an undisclosed number of employees, something it said was necessary to ensure its “long-term sustainability” amid challenging indu...</div>
