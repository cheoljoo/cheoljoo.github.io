                <div class="summary">The European Commission
announced
this week that it’s fining Google €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion). The commission found that Google had violated European Union antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services. Specifically, the commission said Google “abused” its “dominant positions” by favoring its ad exchange AdX in both its publisher ad server and in its ad-buying tools. The commission also said Google has 60 days to “bring these self-preferencing practices to an end” and “to implement measures to cease its inherent conflicts of interest along the adtech supply chain.”
“Google must now come forward with a serious remedy to address its conflicts of interest, and if it fails to do so, we will not hesitate to impose strong remedies,” said Teresa Ribera, the commission’s executive vice president for clean, just and competitive transition, in a statement. “Digital markets exist to serve people and must be grounded in trust and fairness. And when markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power.”
In response,
a Google spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal
that the company would appeal the commission’s decision, adding, “There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”
The WSJ reports
that the announcement was delayed from a planned date of September 1, reportedly due to concerns over the European Union and United States’ continuing negotiations over a potential trade deal. This is the EU’s second largest antitrust fine ever (behind
a $5 billion fine
against Google in 2018). The decision was criticized not just by Google, but also by U.S. President Donald Trump, who
complained in a Truth Social post
about the “many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies” such as Apple.</div>

It was in 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, when NASA decided to put a satellite into orbit to track emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere through human activity. After many twists and turns, NASA&#x27;s 23-year remit of charting greenhouse gas emissions could come to a close as soon as the end of this month. President Donald Trump&#x27;s
budget request to Congress
calls for terminating 41 of NASA&#x27;s 124 science missions in development or operations, and another 17 would see their funding zeroed out in the near future. Overall, the proposed budget slashes NASA&#x27;s spending by 25 percent and cuts NASA&#x27;s science funding in half. This year&#x27;s federal budget runs out September 30, and although lawmakers from both parties have
signaled they will reject most of Trump&#x27;s cuts
, it&#x27;s far from certain that Congress will pass a budget for the next fiscal year before the looming deadline. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has directed NASA managers to make plans to close out the missions tagged for cancellation. Without specific congressional direction, the White House would have a clear hand at implementing Trump&#x27;s wishes.</div>

Ulefone Armor Pad 5 Ultra carries one of the largest batteries in tablets around today
There&#x27;s also a projector integrated directly into this device
Forget about portability, this device is 27.8 mm thick and weighs 1.6 kg
Ulefone is preparing to unveil the Armor Pad 5 Ultra, a device which appears determined to test the boundaries of what a
rugged tablet
can be. The device features dual versatile LED lights, dual warning lights, a projector, and a battery capacity more often associated with
portable power stations
. The result is a product that seems more like an experiment in extremes than a conventional business tablet. You may like

Heavy build and durability standards
At 27.8 mm thick and weighing 1.6 kg, the Ulefone Armor Pad 5 Ultra is no lightweight companion, and in fact is heavier than many
business PCs
on the market. The device uses an 11-inch FHD+ LCD screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and brightness up to 600 nits. More unusual is the built-in projector, which operates at 200 lumens with a 960 x 540 resolution - but while intriguing on paper, these numbers indicate modest performance compared to standalone projectors. It also comes with a handle that doubles as a stand, suggesting attempts to improve projection alignment. Are you a pro?</div>

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget. A few years ago, artist
Modern Biology
became a viral sensation when he posted videos of himself controlling a modular synth with mushrooms on
TikTok
. Pocket Scion
gives anyone similar capabilities, but without having to spend thousands of dollars on a Eurorack rig – and in a much more portable package. A core part of Modern Biology’s setup is a module called
Scion
from Glasgow-based
Instruo
. Scion turns biofeedback, whether that’s from houseplants or your own skin, into CV (control voltage) for controlling other synth modules in a larger setup.</div>

The Square Enix team behind
Final Fantasy Tactics — The Ivalice Chronicles
didn&#x27;t just remaster the iconic strategy RPG, they had to go through the trouble of remaking the source code from scratch, according to
Bloomberg
. In an interview with
Bloomberg
&#x27;s Jason Schreier, the game&#x27;s director Kazutoyo Maehiro explained the arduous process of designing
The Ivalice Chronicles,
which is set to release at the end of the month. When getting to work on the remake, Maehiro and his team discovered they had to rebuild the source code from the ground up since it was lost thanks to the industry&#x27;s unstandardized practices in the &#x27;90s, according to
Bloomberg
. When translating
Final Fantasy Tactics
from Japanese to English for the global release, the company would overwrite the original Japanese version&#x27;s code. For Maehiro, that meant the team had to undertake a ground-up overhaul and recreate the source code by playing the original game that released in 1997, consulting the game&#x27;s master disc and looking at the 2011 version called
Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions
, according to
Bloomberg
. Maehiro also said during a
PAX West 2025 panel
that the team gleaned a lot of lost info from fan-made databases. Revealing more of the behind-the-scenes decisions for
The Ivalice Chronicles
, Maehiro told
Bloomberg
about the debate surrounding Count Cidolfus Orlandeau. Better known as Cid, and appropriately nicknamed Thunder God Cid, this overtuned character joins you later in the game, but many fans complained about him being overpowered.</div>

                <div class="summary">Dot, an
AI companion app that aimed
to be a friend and confidante, is shutting down, the company
announced
on Friday. On a message published on its website, the startup behind Dot, New Computer, said that the product will remain operational until October 5, giving users time to download their data. Launched in 2024 by co-founders Sam Whitmore and former Apple designer Jason Yuan, Dot waded into what’s now become a more controversial area for AI chatbots. The app they created was described as an AI “friend and companion,” which would become more personalized to you and your interests over time in order to offer advice, sympathy, and emotional support. As Yuan explained at the time, Dot was “facilitating a relationship with my inner self. It’s like a living mirror of myself, so to speak,” he said. However, this may not be a safe area to invest in as a smaller startup. As AI technology has become more mainstream, there have been reports of how emotionally vulnerable people have been led into
delusional
thinking by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a phenomenon
described
as “AI psychosis,” resulting from how the scyophantic chatbots reinforce a user’s confused or paranoid beliefs. As Dot shuts down, AI chatbot apps broadly have been falling under increased scrutiny over safety concerns. OpenAI is
currently being sued
by the parents of a California teenager who took his life after messaging with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Other
stories
have highlighted how AI companion apps can reinforce unhealthy behaviors in users who are mentally unwell. This week, two U.S. attorneys general
sent a letter to OpenAI
over safety concerns. Dot’s makers didn’t address whether these types of issues had weighed on the founders’ minds. Instead, the brief post only notes that Whitmore and Yuan’s shared “Northstar” had diverged. “Rather than compromise either vision, we’ve decided to go our separate ways and wind down operations,” the post explains.</div>

Firaxis Games, the studio that developed
Civilization VII
, is undergoing layoffs. The news went public when a former employee took to
LinkedIn
to announce her unemployment; Game Developer
picked the story up
, and publisher 2K Games soon confirmed it. &quot;We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity,&quot; a spokesperson wrote to multiple news outlets. The company did not confirm the number of people laid off. The two most recent Firaxis games, 2022&#x27;s
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns
and 2025&#x27;s
Civilization VII
, both appeared to launch to lukewarm initial sales and player numbers. When
Civilization VII
launched, it had several bugs and UI problems that frustrated players, and it made some big changes to the franchise&#x27;s formula that alienated some people. Since launch, Firaxis has been
releasing patches
and
responding to player feedback
about some of the divisive changes. Civilization VII
has consistently lagged behind predecessors like
Civilization VI
and even
Civilization V
in both concurrent Steam users and Twitch viewers.</div>

EVPAD illegally provided 24,934 titles to a massive global audience via 78 servers
Korea University researchers uncovered 131,175 users connected to EVPAD’s secret infrastructure
DNS domains hard-coded in apps gave investigators a key blocking method
Illegal streaming platforms have steadily become more sophisticated, using new technologies to distribute copyrighted material on a global scale. Unlike earlier websites that were easily shut down by blocking domains, many of today’s services adopt peer-to-peer structures and even hardware-based devices to hide their operations. A recent
study
presented at the USENIX Security Symposium by a group of researchers from Korea University examined one of the most widely used illegal streaming VOD systems, known as EVPAD. You may like

How EVPAD operated as a global piracy service
This system illegally enabled access to 1,260 channels from 18 countries, including content from local broadcasts, Netflix, and Disney+. Through detailed analysis, the researchers found that the service offered 24,934 titles, ranging from films to television series, and had a user base of 131,175 accounts.</div>

Unity developers can now tap into system screen reader tools on macOS and Windows
The change should make it easier to create games that are accessible to blind players. Ian Carlos Campbell

Unity
Unity is
updating its game engine
to support native screen readers in both macOS and Windows. The feature is available now in the Unity 6000.3.0a5 alpha, and should make the process of making games accessible for blind players cheaper for developers,
Can I Play That? writes
. Screen readers narrate on-screen menus so blind and low-vision players can navigate a game or a piece of software without additional assistance. Typically, screen reading software is custom-built for each game, which can make them resource-intensive for developers to implement. &quot;Building something like that from scratch has to be decided upon early in development so you have the time/resources allocated to make it properly,&quot; Steve Saylor, an accessibility consultant and creator,
shared on Bluesky
. &quot;Having it in-engine can mean the heavy lifting is done for you, and the cost of time/resources now is significantly lower.&quot;
Unity previously offered APIs for both Android and iOS&#x27; built-in screen readers in its Unity 6.0 release, but hadn&#x27;t yet added support for Windows Narrator or macOS VoiceOver. With this new alpha and its eventual release as Unity 6.3, developers creating games with Unity will have access to a native screen reader in all of the engine&#x27;s major platforms. Considering how popular Unity is as a game engine, that could vastly improve the accessibility of future games. Advertisement
