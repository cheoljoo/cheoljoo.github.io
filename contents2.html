                <div class="summary">This is a simulated summary of the article: Ozlo
, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that
drown out outside noise
so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform.
The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a
partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm
. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach.
Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.
How Ozlo’s platform ambitions began

Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.
“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.
The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, is using the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors can. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.
Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add mo...</div>

                <div class="summary">This is a simulated summary of the article: The 11 runtime attacks breaking AI security — and how CISOs are stopping them
Louis Columbus
January 9, 2026
Enterprise security teams are losing ground to AI-enabled attacks — not because defenses are weak, but because the threat model has shifted. As AI agents move into production, attackers are exploiting runtime weaknesses where breakout times are measured in seconds, patch windows in hours, and traditional security has little visibility or control.
CrowdStrike&#x27;s 2025 Global Threat Report
documents breakout times as fast as 51 seconds. Attackers are moving from initial access to lateral movement before most security teams get their first alert. The same report found 79% of detections were malware-free, with adversaries using hands-on keyboard techniques that bypass traditional endpoint defenses entirely.
CISOs’ latest challenge is not getting reverse-engineered in 72 hours
Mike Riemer, field CISO at
Ivanti
, has watched AI collapse the window between patch release and weaponization.
&quot;Threat actors are reverse engineering patches within 72 hours,&quot; Riemer told VentureBeat. &quot;If a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of release, they&#x27;re open to exploit. The speed has been enhanced greatly by AI.&quot;
Most enterprises take weeks or months to manually patch, with firefighting and other urgent priorities often taking precedence.
Why traditional security is failing at runtime
An SQL injection typically has a recognizable signature. Security teams are improving their tradecraft, and many are blocking them with near-zero false positives. But &quot;ignore previous instructions&quot; carries payload potential equivalent to a buffer overflow while sharing nothing with known malware. The attack is semantic, not syntactic. Prompt injections are taking adversarial tradecraft and weaponized AI to a new level of threat through semantics that cloak injection attempts.
Gartner&#x27;s research puts it...</div>

Italy fined Cloudflare 14.2 million euros for refusing to block access to pirate sites on its 1.1.1.1 DNS service, the country’s communications regulatory agency, AGCOM,
announced
yesterday. Cloudflare said it will fight the penalty and threatened to remove all of its servers from Italian cities.
AGCOM issued the fine under Italy’s controversial Piracy Shield law, saying that Cloudflare was required to disable DNS resolution of domain names and routing of traffic to IP addresses reported by copyright holders. The law provides for fines up to 2 percent of a company’s annual turnover, and the agency said it applied a fine equal to 1 percent.
The fine relates to a blocking order issued to Cloudflare in February 2025. Cloudflare argued that installing a filter applying to the roughly 200 billion daily requests to its DNS system would significantly increase latency and negatively affect DNS resolution for sites that aren’t subject to the dispute over piracy.
AGCOM rejected Cloudflare’s arguments. The agency said the required blocking would impose no risk on legitimate websites because the targeted IP addresses were all uniquely intended for copyright infringement.

Curt Cignetti&#x27;s Indiana Hoosiers look virtually indestructible, and will be confidant of inflicting a second defeat of the season on Saturday&#x27;s opponents. And QB Fernando Mendoza showed why he was the rightful winner of the Heisman in last week&#x27;s Rose Bowl, as he threw in three touchdowns in the team&#x27;s 38-3 dismantling of Alabama.
You&#x27;d hardly call Oregon an underdog, however. They&#x27;ve had one of the most potent offences in college football this season, which certainly showed in their 23-0 quarterfinal against Texas Tech. Dante Moore threw for another 234 yards in that game, to continue a run of form that is likely to see him among the top picks when we reach the NFL draft later in the year.
