Bee AI
Bee
is an affordable pendant priced at $49.99 that can either be clipped to your clothing or worn like a fitness band. This device records everything it hears and learns your routines and preferences to create reminders and notes for you. It even features a mute button for those times you want some privacy.
The companion app (currently available only on iOS) is included with a $19 monthly subscription. The app allows you to interact with Bee directly and ask it questions. You can also get key takeaways from your day and chronological transcripts of your conversations.
Amazon recently
acquired
the wearables startup in July.

As LLMs have continued to improve, there has been some discussion in the industry about the continued need for standalone data labeling tools, as LLMs are increasingly able to work with all types of data.
HumanSignal,
the lead commercial vendor behind the open-source Label Studio program, has a different view. Rather than seeing less demand for data labeling, the company is seeing more.
Earlier this month, HumanSignal acquired Erud AI and launched its physical Frontier Data Labs for novel data collection. But creating data is only half the challenge. Today, the company is tackling what comes next: proving the AI systems trained on that data actually work. The new multi-modal agent evaluation capabilities let enterprises validate complex AI agents generating applications, images, code,  and video.
&quot;If you focus on the enterprise segments, then all of the AI solutions that they&#x27;re building still need to be evaluated, which is just another word for data labeling by humans and even more so by experts,&quot; HumanSignal co-founder and CEO Michael Malyuk told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview.
The intersection of data labeling and agentic AI evaluation
Having the right data is great, but that&#x27;s not the end goal for an enterprise. Where modern data labeling is headed is evaluation.
It&#x27;s a fundamental shift in what enterprises need validated: not whether their model correctly classified an image, but whether their AI agent made good decisions across a complex, multi-step task involving reasoning, tool usage and code generation.
If evaluation is just data labeling for AI outputs, then the shift from models to agents represents a step change in what needs to be labeled.</div>

For months, the Trump administration has warned that semiconductor tariffs are coming soon, leaving the tech industry on pins and needles after a chaotic year of unpredictable tariff regimes collectively cost firms billions.
The semiconductor tariffs are key to Donald Trump’s economic agenda, which is intended to force more manufacturing into the US by making it more expensive to import materials and products. He
campaigned on axing the CHIPS Act
—which provided subsidies to companies investing in manufacturing chips in the US—complaining that it was a “horrible, horrible thing” to “give hundreds of billions of dollars” away when the US could achieve the same objective by instead taxing companies and “use whatever is left over” of CHIPS funding to “reduce debt.” However, as 2025 winds down, the US president faces pressure on all sides to delay semiconductor tariffs, insiders
told Reuters
, and it appears that he is considering caving.
According to “two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations,” US officials have privately told industry and government stakeholders that semiconductor tariffs will likely be delayed.
A fourth insider suggested Trump was hesitant to impose tariffs that could rock the
recent US-China trade truce
, while Reuters noted that Trump may also be hesitant to announce new tariffs during the holiday shopping season that risk increasing prices of popular consumer tech products.</div>
