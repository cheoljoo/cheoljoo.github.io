OpenAI launches new agentic coding model only minutes after Anthropic drops its own
On Monday,
OpenAI launched Codex
, an agentic coding tool marketed to software developers. Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex:
GPT-5.3 Codex
. The company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely “write and review code” to one that can do “nearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.” Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create “highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.”
OpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25 percent faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company’s first model that “was instrumental in creating itself,” meaning that the company’s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing. The new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a
new agentic coding model
released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models. Topics

OpenAI
on Wednesday released
GPT-5.3-Codex
, which the company calls its most capable coding agent to date, in an announcement timed to land at the exact same moment Anthropic unveiled its own flagship model upgrade,
Claude Opus 4.6
. The synchronized launches mark the opening salvo in what industry observers are calling the AI coding wars — a high-stakes battle to capture the enterprise software development market. The dueling announcements came amid an already heated week between the two AI giants, who are also
set to air competing Super Bowl advertisements
on Sunday, and whose executives have been trading barbs publicly over business models, access, and corporate ethics. &quot;I love building with this model; it feels like more of a step forward than the benchmarks suggest,&quot;
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X
minutes after the launch. He later added: &quot;It was amazing to watch how much faster we were able to ship 5.3-Codex by using 5.3-Codex, and for sure this is a sign of things to come.&quot;
That claim —
that the model helped build itself
— is a significant milestone in AI development. According to OpenAI&#x27;s announcement, the Codex team used early versions of
GPT-5.3-Codex
to debug its own training runs, manage deployment infrastructure, and diagnose test results and evaluations. The company describes it as &quot;our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.&quot;
OpenAI&#x27;s new coding model posts record-breaking benchmark scores, outpacing Anthropic&#x27;s Claude by double digits
The new model posts substantial gains across multiple industry benchmarks. GPT-5.3-Codex
achieves 57% on

One of the weirdest corners of the Internet is suddenly hard to find on Bing, after the search engine inexplicably started blocking approximately 1.5 million independent websites hosted on Neocities. Founded in 2013 to archive the
“aesthetic awesomeness” of GeoCities websites
, Neocities keeps the spirit of the 1990s Internet alive. It lets users design free websites without relying on standardized templates devoid of personality. For hundreds of thousands of people building websites around
art
, niche
fandoms
, and special
expertise
—or simply seeking a place to
get a little weird online
—Neocities provides a blank canvas that can be endlessly personalized when compared to a Facebook page. Delighted
visitors
discovering these sites are more likely to navigate by hovering flashing pointers over a web of spinning GIFs than clicking a hamburger menu or infinitely scrolling. That’s the style of Internet that Kyle Drake, Neocities’ founder, strives to maintain. So he was surprised when he noticed that Bing was curiously blocking Neocities sites last summer. At first, the issue seemed resolved by contacting Microsoft, but after receiving more recent reports that users were struggling to log in, Drake discovered that another complete block was implemented in January. Even more concerning, he saw that after delisting the front page, Bing had started pointing users to a copycat site where he was alarmed to learn t...</div>

I&#x27;ve been critical of the
Nintendo Switch 2
in previous stories, given the price of its games and, to a lesser extent, the handheld&#x27;s price itself, but after giving it a shot, it&#x27;s a strong recommendation. You can now grab the
Nintendo Switch 2 bundle on Best Buy for $629.95 (was
$684.95
)
. The bundle includes
Mario Kart World
and
Donkey Kong Bananza
, two exclusive Switch 2 titles that showcase the fun ready to be had with the console this
President&#x27;s Day
. I&#x27;ve bought and played both games (not for $80), and I can say that they serve as perfect introductions to the Switch ecosystem, especially if you&#x27;ve not played many Nintendo games. While I still own my
Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS
handheld, ready to be used for a bigger library of games, the Nintendo Switch 2 is the ideal device if you don&#x27;t always want to tweak power settings or graphics setti...</div>

The Wall Street Journal
published a blockbuster story about Meta’s own dismal findings about teen girls’ mental health on Instagram, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wondered whether Meta should change how it studies its platforms’ potential harms. “Recent events have made me consider whether we should change our approach to research and analytics around social issues,” Zuckerberg wrote in a September 15th, 2021, email to top executives including then-COO Sheryl Sandberg and head of global affairs Nick Clegg.</div>

Everything we know about Valve&#x27;s new Steam Machine
The compact Linux PC aims to do for consoles what the Steam Deck did for handhelds. Ian Carlos Campbell

Valve
The Steam Machine is back from the dead. Not as a Valve-supported program for manufacturers to create living room PCs, but instead a home console sibling to the
Steam Deck
. Valve introduced its second attempt at ruling the living room in a surprise hardware announcement in November 2025, and paired the new
Steam Machine
with a new Steam Controller and a wireless VR headset it calls the
Steam Frame
. Since the announcement, as is often the case with Valve, some details remain elusive, however. While we wait for the release of the company&#x27;s new hardware lineup in 2026, and more information straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth, here&#x27;s everything we know about the hardware, software and price of the Steam Machine. What&#x27;s the Steam Machine&#x27;s hardware like? Valve
Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine is utilitarian and bespoke. The PC is a black, 5.98 x 6.39 x 6.14 inch (152 x 162.4 x 156mm) box, with ports and a grille for a fan in the back and a removable faceplate and customizable LED light strip in the front. Inside, Valve says the Steam Machine features a &quot;semi-custom&quot; AMD Zen 4 CPU with six cores and up to 4.8GHz clock speeds, and a &quot;semi-custom&quot; RDNA3 AMD GPU, along with 16GB DDR RAM, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM and either 512GB or 2TB of storage.

While these specs make the Steam Machine more powerful than the aging Steam Deck (which shipped in 2022 with its own custom AMD chip) Valve has been careful not to oversell the capabilities of the box.</div>

Taryn Plumb

Today’s LLMs excel at reasoning, but can still struggle with context. This is particularly true in real-time ordering systems like
Instacart
. Instacart CTO Anirban Kundu calls it the &quot;brownie recipe problem.&quot;
It&#x27;s not as simple as telling an LLM ‘I want to make brownies.’ To be truly assistive when planning the meal, the model must go beyond that simple directive to understand what’s available in the user’s market based on their preferences — say, organic eggs versus regular eggs — and factor that into what’s deliverable in their geography so food doesn’t spoil. This among other critical factors. For Instacart, the challenge is juggling latency with the right mix of context to provide experiences in, ideally, less than one second’s time. “If reasoning itself takes 15 seconds, and if every interaction is that slow, you&#x27;re gonna lose the user,” Kundu said at a recent VB event. Mixing reasoning, real-world state, personalization
In grocery delivery, there’s a “world of reasoning” and a “world of state” (what’s available in the real world),
Kundu
noted, both of which must be understood by an LLM along with user preference. But it’s not as simple as loading the entirety of a user’s purchase history and known interests into a reasoning model. “Your LLM is gonna blow up into a size that will be unmanageable,” said Kundu. To get around this, Instacart splits processing into chunks. First, data is fed into a large foundational model that can understand intent and categorize products. That processed data is then routed to
small language models (SLMs)
designed for catalog context (the types of food or other items that work together) and semantic understanding. In the case of catalog context, the SLM must be able to process mu...</div>

Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health under the Trump administration, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Tuesday. In the wide-ranging hearing, Bhattacharya defended the chaotic and disruptive cuts at the institutes he helms while carefully wording responses related to vaccines—seemingly to avoid contradicting his boss, anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As Bhattacharya testified, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the HELP committee’s ranking member, released a
report
outlining
the state of the NIH
. The report concluded that the Trump administration is “failing American patients,” and “destroying medical research through cuts to research grants, terminations of clinical trials, and the chaos it has created.”
Since Trump took office, the NIH has terminated or frozen hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, the report found.</div>

Back when artificial intelligence was still poorly understood outside research labs,
Ray Kurzweil
was already frustrated with how narrowly it was being discussed. In a 1991 interview with
Computerworld
, he pushed back forcefully against claims that AI had failed to live up to its promise. “That’s unfair, because every time we master a particular area of AI, it ceases to be considered AI. It’s just like a magic trick — when you know how it’s done, it’s no longer magic,” he
said
, adding, “Take machine vision, for example, which today [in 1991] is a $300 million business. People don’t consider that AI, but it is part of AI.”
Kurzweil argued that public expectations were skewed not by failure, but by familiarity.</div>
