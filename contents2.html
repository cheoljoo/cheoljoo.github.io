The fund aims to provide retail investors with access to early-stage startup investments, a domain traditionally dominated by accredited investors and VCs. This initiative follows a previous controversial &quot;tokenized stocks&quot; offering in the EU, which was denounced by OpenAI for not actually representing company stock. While the application is public, specific details such as the number of shares and management fees are yet to be disclosed, and Robinhood has declined to comment on the fund&#x27;s availability.</div>

                <div class="summary">Ed Brzytwa, VP of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), explains that tech firms are facing a &quot;triple whammy&quot; of tariffs, creating a &quot;bureaucratic nightmare&quot; due to &quot;tariff stacking.&quot; This involves products being double, triple, or even quadruple-taxed on materials like semiconductors, polysilicon, or copper. Brzytwa notes that unpredictable tariff regimes under Donald Trump have made long-term planning impossible for tech companies, potentially leading to higher consumer prices. While some companies have front-loaded inventory to maintain prices for the holiday season, others, particularly in the video game industry, have already warned of price hikes. The CTA will monitor the situation to assess the burden of tariffs and their long-term impact on consumer technology companies.</div>

                <div class="summary">This article compares Sonos and WiiM multi-room audio ecosystems, prompted by Sonos&#x27;s controversial 2024 software redesign that eroded user trust. While Sonos offers a comprehensive hardware ecosystem, its software has become less intuitive. WiiM, a smaller brand, is gaining traction with an app reminiscent of older Sonos versions and more affordable hardware, though its device lineup is currently smaller. WiiM excels in advanced audio settings, supporting higher resolutions and offering more EQ options than Sonos. The article advises long-time Sonos users with extensive setups to stay, but suggests those with simpler Sonos systems or new users consider WiiM, especially if Apple AirPlay is a priority (as some WiiM devices lack it). WiiM is expected to expand its hardware offerings to compete more directly with Sonos.</div>

This decision upholds a 2023 jury verdict that Google&#x27;s Android app store and payment systems constitute illegal monopolies. Consequently, Google faces a 30-day deadline to allow developers to bypass Google Play Billing, link to outside app store downloads, and set their own prices. By summer 2026, Google must also permit rival app stores within the Play Store and share its full app catalog. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has publicly stated that Google Play now has 30 days to offer competing payments in the USA, free of restrictive practices, citing strong precedent from Epic v. Apple.</div>

Two new smart glasses models are expected, including Meta&#x27;s first consumer-ready glasses with a display, codenamed &quot;Hypernova,&quot; which will likely cost around $800 and feature a dedicated wristband for gesture control. Another new model, Oakley Sphaera glasses with a camera but no display, is also expected. Meta AI will be a major theme, with new features for glasses and apps, including non-English &quot;character-driven&quot; bots. Zuckerberg is also expected to discuss his vision for &quot;superintelligence,&quot; despite reports of delays and struggles with the larger Llama 4 model and potential shifts away from open-source AI. Metaverse updates, particularly for Horizon Worlds and AI-powered NPCs, are also on the agenda, along with potential news on third-party VR headsets running Meta Horizon OS.</div>

OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor says we’re in an AI bubble (but that’s okay)
Bret Taylor, board chair at OpenAI and CEO of
AI agent startup Sierra
, was asked in
a recent interview with The Verge
whether he agreed with OpenAI CEO
Sam Altman’s declaration
that “someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI.”
Taylor echoed Altman’s sentiments, suggesting that we are indeed in an AI bubble — but like Altman, he didn’t sound too worried about it. “I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time, and there’s a lot of historical precedent for both of those things being true at the same time.”
Specifically, Taylor compared today’s AI landscape to the dot-com bubble of the late ‘90s. While many companies failed when the bubble burst, he argued that “all the people in 1999 were kind of right.”

The US is trying to kick-start a “nuclear energy renaissance”

I
n May,
President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”
Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through
nuclear fission
, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases. The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing
400 gigawatts
by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.</div>

Is it too early to talk about Christmas? Sorry for mentioning it, but I have a fantastic deal that will be a perfect fit for a children&#x27;s present. It&#x27;s the
Fujifilm Instax Pal, which is on sale at Argos for £44.99 (was £71.99)
. That&#x27;s a big discount that makes the cute little camera more affordable than ever. Unlike many instant cameras that sit around in a drawer once the paper supply has run out, this digital-only mini camera is more likely to get extended use. You can connect it to the Instax app or transfer the photos to your computer. Either way, you&#x27;ll be enjoying your photos or your children&#x27;s photos for many years to come. Today&#x27;s best Fujifilm Instax Pal deal
Fujifilm Instax Pal:
was £71.99
now £44.99
at Argos
A digital camera with a companion app that makes photo capture, for young children especially, an absolute joy. If you&#x27;d like instant printing, then you&#x27;ll also need an Instax Link printer, but it&#x27;s not absolutely necessary. The £27 discount sees it drop to a temptingly low price for a cut and fun gift idea. Read more

Despite only awarding it 3.5 out of five stars, our reviewer actually found the
Fujifilm Instax Pal
the funnest of all the Instax cameras he&#x27;s ever used. He loved the super cute design and a fun user interface, as well as the fact that it handles better than clunky Instax alternatives.</div>

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget. We only just put Apple’s
iPhone 17 launch event
behind us, but
Bloomberg’s
Mark Gurman is already glancing into his crystal ball to see what’s next for the company. In today’s
Power On
newsletter Gurman says that there are at least 10 more products from Apple that are expected to launch either later this year or in the first half of 2026. Some of those products have been rumored for some time, or are just kind of obvious upgrades. The M5 iPad Pro, for instance, is a matter of when not if. Though the rumors that it will have a
second front facing camera
for those that prefer to use their iPad in portrait mode is interesting. The iPad Pro could be the first Apple product with an
M5
as it’s expected to launch in October, with upgraded MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to follow in early 2026.</div>

Stop Killing Games
The
Stop Killing Games
campaign is continuing to gain momentum after hitting more than
a million signatures
in July. After a July 31st deadline, the movement secured around 1.45 million signatures, which the organizers are currently in the process of verifying. The initiative aims to enact legislation that preserves access to video games, even when developers decide to end support, as seen with Ubisoft when it delisted
The Crew
and revoked access to players who already purchased the game. There were some early concerns about the potential for falsely-submitted signatures, but the
latest update
from organizers said that early reports show around 97 percent of the signatures are valid. According to the
European Commission&#x27;s website
, EU authorities have three months to verify the signatures once they are submitted. After that, the organizers said they will personally deliver the petition to the European Commission. With initial estimates clearing the threshold of one million verified signatures, the following steps involve getting meetings with both the European Commission and the European Parliament. From the date of the initiative&#x27;s submission, the European Union will get six months to decide what to do regarding the Stop Killing Games movement. There is the possibility of the governing bodies not taking any action at all, but the organizers said they are &quot;preparing to ensure our initiative cannot be ignored.&quot; To prepare for the meetings, the organizers said they will be reaching out to members of Parliament and the Commission, while also trying to counter any misinformation or industry lobbying.</div>
