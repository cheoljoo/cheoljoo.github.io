                <div class="summary">This is a placeholder summary of the article. Without a doubt, one of the hottest new startup accelerators in tech right now is Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program. Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In a January blog post, the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort. The program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on. There are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The program invests up to $1 million into each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors. In comparison, Y Combinator typically takes 7% of the company for $500,000. Speedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel. Given the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications for the next cohort open in April, though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said. Focus on th...</div>

NanoClaw solves one of OpenClaw&#x27;s biggest security issues — and it&#x27;s already powering the creator&#x27;s biz Carl Franzen February 11, 2026 Credit: VentureBeat made with Google Nano Banana Pro on fal.ai The rapid viral adoption of Austrian developer Peter Steinberger&#x27;s open source AI assistant OpenClaw in recent weeks has sent enterprises and indie developers into a tizzy. It&#x27;s easy to easy why: OpenClaw is freely available now and offers a powerful means of autonomously completing work and performing tasks across a user&#x27;s entire computer, phone, or even business with natural language prompts that spin up swarms of agents. Since its release in November 2025, it&#x27;s captured the market with over 50 modules and broad integrations — but its &quot;permissionless&quot; architecture raised alarms among developers and security teams. Enter NanoClaw , a lighter, more secure version which debuted under an open source MIT License on January 31, 2026, and achieved explosive growth—surpassing 7,000 stars on GitHub in just over a week. Created by Gavriel Cohen—an experienced software engineer who spent seven years at website builder Wix.com—the project was built to address the &quot;security nightmare&quot; inherent in complex, non-sandboxed agent frameworks. Cohen and his brother Lazer are also co-founders of Qwibit , a new AI-first go-to-market agency, and vice president and CEO, respectively, of Concrete Media , a respected public relations firm that often works with tech businesses covered by VentureBeat. Gavriel Cohen, creator of NanoClaw, VP of Concrete Media and co-founder of Qwibit. Credit: Concrete Media NanoClaw’s immediate solution to this architectural anxiety is a hard pivot toward operating system-level isolation. The project places every agent inside isolated Linux containers—utilizing Apple Containers for high-performance execution on macOS or Docker for Linux environments. This creates a st...</div>

The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies. The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. For example , the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act. In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter , criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB , claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue ...</div>

How to cancel Mullvad VPN Mullvad doesn&#x27;t auto-renew, so it&#x27;s easy to cancel — here&#x27;s how. Sam Chapman Senior Writer Wed, February 11, 2026 at 8:00 PM UTC Add Engadget on Google Mullvad VPN logo (Mullvad) This is going to be one of the shortest articles in my series on how to cancel your subscriptions to the best VPNs . Unlike most providers, Mullvad VPN does not automatically renew an expired subscription unless you tell it to. Thanks to its unique pricing approach, cancelling Mullvad is the default option. When you sign up for Mullvad, you pay for as many months upfront as you want at the constant rate of 5 Euro per month (varying with exchange rates). Each month, Mullvad takes 5 Euro out of your account until there&#x27;s nothing left. If you&#x27;re no longer satisfied with Mullvad, all you have to do is stop putting money in. The Mullvad account dashboard. (Sam Chapman for Engadget) If you happen to have originally signed up for Mullvad earlier than the middle of 2022, you may have an auto-renewal account grandfathered in. Mid-2022 is when Mullvad stopped auto-renewing subscriptions and got rid of PayPal integration altogether, but people who had signed up before then had the option to leave auto-renewal on.

                <div class="summary">Monday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. “It’s time for my next chapter,” Wu wrote
in a late-night post
on X. “It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible.”
On its own, it’s a pretty standard tech departure announcement — but it’s part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Five members of
the company’s 12-person founding team
have now left the company, with four of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babushkin
left to found a venture firm
, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month,
citing health issues
.
By all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.
There are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with
bizarre behavior
and
apparent internal tampering
— the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools that
flooded the platform with deepfake pornography
, sparking slow-moving but real
legal consequences
.
Whatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already
spinning up plans for orbital data centers
, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model dev...</div>

Is agentic AI ready to reshape Global Business Services?
N. Shashidar, EdgeVerve
February 10, 2026
Presented by EdgeVerve
Before addressing Global Business Services (GBS), let’s take a step back. Can agentic AI, the type of AI able to take goal-driven action, transform not just GBS but any kind of enterprise? And has it done so yet?
As with many new technologies, rhetoric has outpaced deployment in this case. While 2025 was “supposed to be the year of agentic AI,” it didn’t turn out that way, according to VentureBeat Contributing Editor Taryn Plumb. Leaning on input from Google Cloud and integrated development environment (IDE) company Replit, Plumb reported in a
December 2025 VentureBeat post
that what has been missing are the fundamentals required to scale.
Given the experience of Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative (gen)AI, this outcome is not surprising. In a survey conducted at the February 2025
Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Network (SSON) summit
, 65% of GBS organizations responded that they had yet to complete a GenAI project. One can safely say that the adoption of the more recently arrived agentic AI is still in its very nascent stages for enterprises, including GBS.
The role of agentic AI in Global Business Services
There are good reasons, nonetheless, to focus on the tremendous potential of agentic AI and its application to the GBS sector.
Stripped of hype, Agentic AI unlocks capabilities in the orchestration layer of software workflows that weren’t practical before. It does so through a range of techniques, including (but not requiring) LLMs. While enterprises may indeed be missing certain fundamentals needed to deploy agentic AI at scale, those prerequisites are not out of reach.
As for GBS and Global Capability Centers (GCCs), they have already been undergoing a makeover, from back-office extensions into increasingly strategic enterprise partners. Agentic AI is a natural fit because one of its standard use cases involves IT oper...</div>

Wikipedia editors are discussing whether to blacklist Archive.today because the archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blogger who wrote a post in 2023 about the mysterious website’s anonymous maintainer.
In a
request for comment page
, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo.
Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls.
“Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community
decided to blacklist it
in 2013. In 2016, the decision
was overturned
, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.”
Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely
not
more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintai...</div>

Microsoft launches scanner to detect poisoned language models before deployment
Backdoored LLMs can hide malicious behavior until specific trigger phrases appear
The scanner identifies abnormal attention patterns tied to hidden backdoor triggers
Microsoft
has announced the development of a new scanner designed to detect hidden backdoors in open-weight large language models used across enterprise environments.
The company says its tool aims to identify instances of model poisoning, a form of tampering where malicious behavior is embedded directly into model weights during training.
These backdoors can remain dormant, allowing affected
LLMs
to behave normally until narrowly defined trigger conditions activate unintended responses.
