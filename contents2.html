                <div class="summary">Tesla is “working on” redesigning its door handles so they are less likely to trap people inside the company’s cars, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen
told Bloomberg News
on Wednesday.
The news comes just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an probe into Tesla’s door handles, and one week after a Bloomberg News investigation highlighted multiple instances where owners or passengers were stuck in their cars following a crash.
Von Holzhausen didn’t specify when Tesla made the decision to rethink how its door handles work, according to Bloomberg. China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country’s top regulator has not taken a final action.
One of the two apparent problems with Tesla’s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren’t receiving power from the car’s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.
“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. “That’s something that we’re working on.”
NHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.”
Tesla includes instructions in its owner’s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted. But NHTSA noted in its preliminary report that none of the owners who contacted the agency reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings — meaning they likely would not have known what was causing the problem.</div>

The Trump administration yesterday issued a lengthier denial of a whistleblower&#x27;s allegation that DOGE officials at the Social Security Administration (SSA) copied the agency&#x27;s database to an insecure cloud system. The allegation centers on the Numerical Identification System (NUMIDENT) database containing Americans&#x27; personally identifiable information.
The cloud location described by the whistleblower report &quot;is actually a secured server in the agency&#x27;s cloud infrastructure which historically has housed this data and is continuously monitored and overseen—SSA&#x27;s standard practice,&quot; said a
letter
sent yesterday to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
The letter was sent by SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, a Trump appointee who was previously CEO of the financial technology company Fiserv. It came in response to
Crapo&#x27;s request
for information.
&quot;I can confirm, based on the agency&#x27;s thorough review, that neither the Numident database nor any of its data has been accessed, leaked, hacked, or shared in any unauthorized fashion,&quot; Bisignano wrote.</div>

The AKG N9 (also called the AKG N9 &#x27;Hybrid&#x27; by the company) are some of the most feature-packed headphones I’ve ever tested. They have a range of ANC modes, useful on-cup touch controls and an included USB-C dongle to instantly get high-res audio from a new device. They also sound great and look fantastic, although a high price and sadly-inflexible design may put off some buyers.

AKG N9: Two minute review
As someone who tests headphones for an income, I&#x27;ve got a roster of &quot;X headphones&quot; for specific tasks. I&#x27;ve got my
best headphones
for music, my
running headphones
, a
gaming headset
, a pair of the
best earbuds
when it&#x27;s too hot for headphones, and a set-up for movies and TV shows too.
The new AKG N9 from
Samsung
&#x27;s sub-brand&#x27;s sub-brand, AKG, didn&#x27;t slot into this line-up as much as they replaced half of them, and it&#x27;s largely down to one handy feature which we also saw in their contemporary earbuds equivalent, the AKG N5.
I&#x27;m not going to do that clickbait headline thing of alluding to a feature and then dancing around the topic, only specifying it 20 paragraphs in: this feature is a dongle which comes build into the AKG N9, and if you plug it into any USB-C slot, it overrides that device&#x27;s audio output into the N9.

Microsoft has been steadily improving its Paint app for Windows 11 in recent years with a
dark mode
, transparency and
layers
, and even AI-powered
image creation
. Now, Microsoft is adding two new Photoshop-like features to Paint.
You’ll soon be able to save your Paint creations as a project file, much like a Photoshop Document (.PSD). The Paint project files are currently being tested with Windows Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channels. “You can now save your creation as an editable Paint project file and seamlessly pick up where you left off,”
explains Dave Grochocki
, principal product manager lead for Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY)
has asked
the CEOs of Discord, Twitch, Valve and Reddit to testify at a hearing on online radicalization. The hearing will be held on October 8, 2025, and is in direct response to
the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk
, an event some have tried to connect to the online communities the alleged shooter,
Tyler Robinson
, participated in.
&quot;Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,&quot; Comer shared in the press release announcing the hearing. &quot;To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.&quot;
Following Kirk&#x27;s death, law enforcement, regulators and the press have exerted significant effort to both understand Robinson&#x27;s actions and structure them into a coherent narrative. The fact that he seemingly engraved the bullets he used with
references to furry memes and the game
Helldivers
implies he may have been immersed in online culture, and could have been influenced by who he interacted with there. But
a recent report
on his Discord chats suggests his motivations are hard to pin down, even for his friends.
In general, online platforms don&#x27;t escape scrutiny after tragic events, so these sorts of hearings are to be expected. Twitch and Discord were both investigated by the
New York
and
New Jersey Attorney Generals
following a 2022 shooting in Buffalo, New York, for example.</div>

Brzytwa notes that unpredictable tariff regimes under Donald Trump have made long-term planning impossible for tech companies, potentially leading to higher consumer prices. While some companies have front-loaded inventory to maintain prices for the holiday season, others, particularly in the video game industry, have already warned of price hikes. The CTA will monitor the situation to assess the burden of tariffs and their long-term impact on consumer technology companies.</div>

                <div class="summary">This article compares Sonos and WiiM multi-room audio ecosystems, prompted by Sonos&#x27;s controversial 2024 software redesign that eroded user trust. While Sonos offers a comprehensive hardware ecosystem, its software has become less intuitive. WiiM, a smaller brand, is gaining traction with an app reminiscent of older Sonos versions and more affordable hardware, though its device lineup is currently smaller. WiiM excels in advanced audio settings, supporting higher resolutions and offering more EQ options than Sonos. The article advises long-time Sonos users with extensive setups to stay, but suggests those with simpler Sonos systems or new users consider WiiM, especially if Apple AirPlay is a priority (as some WiiM devices lack it). WiiM is expected to expand its hardware offerings to compete more directly with Sonos.</div>

This decision upholds a 2023 jury verdict that Google&#x27;s Android app store and payment systems constitute illegal monopolies. Consequently, Google faces a 30-day deadline to allow developers to bypass Google Play Billing, link to outside app store downloads, and set their own prices. By summer 2026, Google must also permit rival app stores within the Play Store and share its full app catalog. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has publicly stated that Google Play now has 30 days to offer competing payments in the USA, free of restrictive practices, citing strong precedent from Epic v. Apple.</div>
