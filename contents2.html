                <div class="summary">When Nigel Morris tells you he’s worried about the economy, you listen. As industry observers know, Morris co-founded Capital One and pioneered lending to subprime borrowers, building an empire on understanding exactly how much financial stress the average American can handle. Now, as an early investor in
Klarna
and other buy-now-pay-later companies like
Aplazo
in Mexico, he’s watching something that makes him deeply uncomfortable.
“To see that people are using [BNPL services] to buy something as basic and fundamental as groceries,” Morris told me on stage at
Web Summit
in Lisbon this week, “I think is a pretty clear indication that a lot of people are struggling.”
The statistics back up his unease. Buy-now-pay-later services have exploded to 91.5 million users in the United States, according to the financial services firm
Empower
, with 25% using the services to finance their groceries as of earlier this year, according to
survey data
released in late October by lending marketplace Lending Tree.
These aren’t the discretionary purchases —  the designer bags and latest Apple headphones that BNPL was marketed for originally. Borrowers aren’t paying it back, either. According to Lending Tree, default rates are accelerating: 42% of BNPL users made at least one late payment in 2025, up from 39% in 2024 and 34% in 2023.
Storm clouds on the horizon
This isn’t just a consumer finance story; it’s a canary in the coal mine for the entire venture-backed fintech ecosystem and beyond. It points to what could develop into a serious problem — one that echoes the warning signs that preceded the 2008 financial meltdown except for one thing: it’s largely invisible.
Most BNPL loans aren’t reported to credit bureaus, creating what regulators call “phantom debt.” That means other lenders can’t see when someone has taken out five different BNPL loans across multiple platforms. The credit system is flying blind.</div>

Human-centric IAM is failing: Agentic AI requires a new identity control plane
Michelle Buckner
November 16, 2025
The race to deploy
agentic AI is on
. Across the enterprise, systems that can plan, take actions and collaborate across business applications promise unprecedented efficiency. But in the rush to automate, a critical component is being overlooked: Scalable security. We are building a workforce of digital employees without giving them a secure way to log in, access data and do their jobs without creating catastrophic risk.
The fundamental problem is that traditional identity and access management (IAM) designed for humans breaks at agentic scale. Controls like static roles, long-lived passwords and one-time approvals are useless when non-human identities can outnumber human ones by 10 to one. To harness the power of agentic AI, identity must evolve from a simple login gatekeeper into the dynamic control plane for your entire AI operation.
“The fastest path to responsible AI is to avoid real data. Use synthetic data to prove value, then earn the right to touch the real thing.” —
Shawn Kanungo, keynote speaker and innovation strategist; bestselling author of The Bold Ones
Why your human-centric IAM is a sitting duck
Agentic AI
does not just use software; it behaves like a user. It authenticates to systems, assumes roles and calls APIs. If you treat these agents as mere features of an application, you invite invisible privilege creep and untraceable actions. A single over-permissioned agent can exfiltrate data or trigger erroneous business processes at machine speed, with no one the wiser until it is too late.
The static nature of legacy IAM is the core vulnerability. You cannot pre-define a fixed role for an agent whose tasks and required data access might change daily. The only way to keep access decisions accurate is to move policy enforcement from a one-time grant to a continuous, runtime evaluation.</div>

The evolution of rationality: How chimps process conflicting evidence
Chimps can take in new evidence, evaluate its strength, and change their minds.

When Aristotle claimed that humans differ from other animals because they have the ability to be rational, he understood rational to mean that we could form our views and beliefs based on evidence, and that we could reconsider that evidence. “You know—ask ourselves if we should really believe that based on the evidence we’ve got,” says Jan M. Engelmann, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley.
Engelmann says that from the beginning of the Western intellectual tradition, people thought that only humans are rational. So, he designed a study to see if rationality shows up in chimpanzees. It turned out that they’re almost as rational as we are.
Food puzzles
“There was quite a bit of research showing that chimpanzees can form their beliefs in response to evidence,” Engelmann says. The experiments usually involved chimpanzees deciding which of the two boxes contained a snack. When the researchers shook both boxes and there was a rattling sound coming from one of them, the chimps almost always chose the box where the rattling came from.
“But no one has ever looked into their ability to revise beliefs in rational ways,” Engelmann explains. He views revision of beliefs as the hallmark of rationality, a perspective that’s consistent with our best knowledge in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. “There are so many irrational ways of responding to counter evidence—you know, ‘I’m gonna keep believing what I believe, I’m not gonna switch my mind,’” Engelmann claims.</div>

If you’re an indie rock fan of a certain age, the name
Stereogum
will probably conjure strong feelings. The site was launched “January 1st, 2002, on a whim,” founder Scott Lapatine told
The Verge
. Originally, this early staple of the music blog era was focused almost entirely on
music discovery
and posting MP3s. “It was the early days of like Windows Media Player and Real Player,” Scott remembers. Today, the site is focused on music journalism and has just relaunched to keep up with a media landscape being overrun by AI.
Lapatine has been with
Stereogum
from the beginning, and watched as both the music and media world rapidly changed around him.</div>

                <div class="summary">Let’s be honest, most tech wearables are bulky and not exactly what you’d describe as pretty. But when you’re regularly wearing something on your hands, you probably want it to look nice and maybe even blend in with the rest of your jewelry. That’s the idea behind Oura’s newest smart ring, the
Oura Ring 4 Ceramic
.
The Ring 4 Ceramic is Oura’s first collection of smart rings that don’t feature metallic finishes. Instead, they’re made from zirconia ceramic, a more wear-resistant ceramic, which Oura says allows for both style and comfort.
I’ve tested the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic for the past three weeks, and here’s my experience with it.
However, before we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that since the software behind the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is the same as the Oura Ring 4, I won’t be getting too much into the software and hardware side of things. For that, you can check out our
Oura Ring 4 review
.
Finish and feel
The Oura Ring 4 comes in four colors: Midnight (dark blue), Cloud (white), Tide (light teal), and Petal (light pink). The ring costs $150 more than the starting price of the standard Ring 4, with a $500 price tag, and is available in sizes 4-15.
I opted for Midnight. Although that shade is technically dark blue, it can appear black from afar  — or even a dark shade of green, I’ve been told. The ring doesn’t look like a tech wearable at first glance, which is nice if you want to prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality.

When compared to the original Ring 4, the Ceramic version is a bit thicker, but it’s not super noticeable. The titanium version is 2.88 mm thick, while the ceramic version measures 3.51 mm.

There is a lot of enterprise data trapped in PDF documents. To be sure, gen AI tools have been able to ingest and analyze PDFs, but accuracy, time and cost have been less than ideal. New technology from
Databricks
could change that.
The company this week detailed its &quot;ai_parse_document&quot; technology, now integrated with Databricks&#x27;
Agent Bricks platform
. The technology addresses a critical bottleneck in enterprise AI adoption: Approximately 80% of enterprise knowledge remains locked in PDFs, reports and diagrams that AI systems struggle to accurately process and understand.
&quot;It&#x27;s a common assumption that parsing PDFs is a solved problem, but in reality, it isn&#x27;t,&quot; Erich Elsen, principal research scientist at Databricks, told VentureBeat. &quot;The challenge isn&#x27;t just that documents are unstructured; it&#x27;s that enterprise PDFs are inherently complex. They mix digital-native content with scanned pages and photos of physical documents, alongside tables, charts and irregular layouts, and most existing tools fail to capture that information accurately.&quot;
The hidden complexity behind document parsing
While optical character recognition (OCR) has existed for decades, Elsen argues that extracting usable, structured data from real-world enterprise documents remains fundamentally unsolved.
Key elements such as tables with merged cells, figure captions and spatial relationships between document elements are routinely dropped or misread by existing tools, making downstream AI applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems or business intelligence dashboards unreliable.</div>

I’ve been involved with the Rebelle Rally since its inception in 2016, either as a competitor or live show host, and over the past 10 years, I’ve seen it evolve from a scrappy rally with big dreams to the world-class event that it is today.
In a nutshell, the Rebelle Rally is the longest competitive off-road rally in the United States, covering over 2,000 kilometers, and it just happens to be for women. Over eight days, teams of two must plot coordinates on a map, figure out their route, and find multiple checkpoints—both marked and unmarked—with no GPS, cell phones, or chase crews. It is not a race for speed but rather a rally for navigational accuracy over some of the toughest terrain California and Nevada have to offer. There are two classes: 4×4 with vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco and X-Cross for cars like the Honda Passport and BMW X5. Heavy modifications aren’t needed, and many teams compete for the coveted Bone Stock award.
For this 10th anniversary, I got back behind the wheel of a 2025 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness as a driver, with Kendra Miller as my navigator, to defend my multiple podium finishes and stage wins and get reacquainted with the technology, or lack thereof, that makes this multi-day competition so special.</div>

IBM introduced two new quantum chips in latest step forward
The Nighthawk chip increases circuit complexity by 30% over its predecessor
Loon is IBM’s first chip to demonstrate full fault-tolerant components
IBM has announced two new quantum chips as part of its wider roadmap to achieve both quantum advantage and fault-tolerant computing by the end of the decade.
The company
says
the new Nighthawk and Loon chips mark a major leap toward making practical quantum computing a reality.
The new hardware, launched alongside advances in fabrication and software, aims to bridge the gap between experimental prototypes and commercially useful quantum systems.

Why you should care about quantum
Building the foundation for quantum advantage
The Nighthawk chip is designed to reach what IBM calls “quantum advantage,” the point at which a quantum computer can outperform all classical computing methods.
With 120 qubits and 218 tunable couplers arranged in a square lattice, the chip supports circuits with 30% greater complexity than its predecessor while keeping error rates low.
IBM expects the processor to handle up to 5,000 two-qubit gates initially, with future iterations scaling to 15,000 by 2028.
This performance could complement high-end
