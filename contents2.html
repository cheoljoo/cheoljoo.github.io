                <div class="summary">Meta announced Wednesday that it will charge developers for running chatbots on WhatsApp in regions where regulators are forcing the company to allow them. The move comes after the company’s ban on third-party chatbots on WhatsApp took effect on January 15. For now, Meta will charge developers in Italy, where the country’s
competition watchdog asked the company to suspend its policy last December
. The company said that the new pricing for non-template responses will begin on February 16. Meta plans to charge $0.0691/ €0.0572 / £0.0498 per message to developers for AI responses. This could result in steep bills for developers if users are exchanging thousands of queries with AI chatbots every day. Earlier this month, Meta sent notices to developers creating an exemption for Italian phone numbers and allowing AI chatbots to serve those customers. At that time, the company didn’t mention any plans to charge developers. Currently, WhatsApp already charges companies for using its API for various template responses to customers, which include use cases like marketing, utility, or authentication. This includes messages users receive about payment reminders and shipping updates. “Where we are legally required to provide AI chatbots through the WhatsApp business API, we are introducing pricing for the companies that choose to use our platform to provide those services,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. This could also establish a precedent for other geographies if Meta has to cave in and allow developers to operate their chatbots. Meta first announced this past October that
it would block all third-party AI chatbots from using WhatsApp through its WhatsApp Business API
. Meta said its systems weren’t designed to handle responses from AI bots and were being strained. Techcrunch event

Factify
emerged from stealth today with
a $73 million seed round
for an ambitious, yet quixotic mission: to bring digital documents beyond the standard formats most businesses use — .PDF, .docx, collaborative cloud files like Google Docs — and into the intelligence era. For Matan Gavish, Factify’s Founder and CEO, this isn&#x27;t just a software upgrade—it is an inevitability he has been obsessed with for years. &quot;The PDF was developed when I was in elementary school,&quot; Gavish told VentureBeat. &quot;The bedrock of the software ecosystem hasn&#x27;t really evolved... someone has to redesign the digital document itself.&quot;
Gavish, a tenured professor of computer science and Stanford PhD, admits that his fixation on administrative file formats is an anomaly for someone with his credentials. &quot;It&#x27;s a very uncool problem to be obsessed with,&quot; he says. &quot;Given the fact that my academic background is AI and machine learning, my mom wanted me to start an AI company because it&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m obsessed and then possessed by documents.&quot;
But that obsession has now attracted a sizeable seed round led by Valley Capital Partners and backed by AI heavyweights like former Google AI chief John Giannandrea. The bet is simple the static rigidity of most digital files has limited their utility, and a better, more intelligent document that actually shares its edit history and ownership with users as intended, is not only possible — it&#x27;s a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. The history of digital documents
To understand why a seed round would balloon to $73 million, you have to understand the scale of the trap businesses are in. There are currently an estimated three trillion PDFs in circulation. &quot;Some peop...</div>

Alarming critics, the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Madhu Gottumukkala, accidentally uploaded sensitive information to a public version of ChatGPT last summer, Politico
reported. According to “four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident,” Gottumukkala’s uploads of sensitive CISA contracting documents triggered multiple internal cybersecurity warnings designed to “stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks.”
Gottumukkala’s uploads happened soon after he joined the agency and sought special permission to use OpenAI’s popular chatbot, which most DHS staffers are blocked from accessing, DHS confirmed to Ars. Instead, DHS staffers use approved AI-powered tools, like the agency’s DHSChat, which “are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks,” Politico reported. It remains unclear why Gottumukkala needed to use ChatGPT.</div>

I&#x27;m still reeling from last week&#x27;s episode of
Spartacus: House of Ashur
. In my opinion,
episode 8
shocked us with the
Starz
show&#x27;s most brutal death yet, as Celadus (Dan Hamill) fell victim to the House of Proculus&#x27; newly acquired female gladiator. It&#x27;s all a plot to build up to Achillia&#x27;s (Tenika Davis) triumphant return to the arena, but now she&#x27;s lost her love and biggest cheerleader. Even worse, Tarchon (Jordi Webber) is choosing to make her life even more difficult. But can the two get it together in

Native Instruments enters into insolvency proceedings, leaving its future uncertain
An administrator has been appointed to restructure the company and potentially sell off assets. Lawrence Bonk

Native Instruments
Music hardware and software manufacturer Native Instruments has entered into preliminary insolvency proceedings,
according to a report by
Create Digital Music
. This is the company behind iconic software like Massive, Traktor and Kontakt and hardware like Maschine+. Native Instruments also owns the brands iZotope, Brainworx and Plugin Alliance. We don&#x27;t have many specifics as to what this entails and what the future of the company will look like. We do know that an administrator has been appointed to handle restructuring and, potentially, to sell off existing assets. Native Instruments employs hundreds of people and their fates also remain uncertain. A private equity firm called Francisco Partners owns a majority stake in the company. It also owns majority stakes in entities like GoodRX and Verifone, among others. This isn&#x27;t the first time Native Instruments has been forced into major restructuring. The company experienced plenty of layoffs and uncertainty
between 2019 and 2020
before being purchased by private equity. Advertisement

Again, we have no idea how this will shake out. It&#x27;s possible that new investors will jump on board and it goes back to business as usual. It&#x27;s also possible everything will be scrapped for parts and sold to the highest bidder. We do know that subsidiary Plugin Alliance seems to be unaffected. It issued a
statement on Facebook
saying that it isn&#x27;t involved with the proceedings and that operations will continue as normal. This means new plugins will be released, along with updates for current software. Everything else...</div>

                <div class="summary">In the wake of TikTok’s U.S. ownership change last week, some users are seeking out
alternative
platforms. One app gaining traction is
UpScrolled
, a social network that pledges to remain impartial to political agendas. The app currently ranks 12th overall in Apple’s App Store and second in the social networking category.
Upscrolled
blends familiar features from Instagram and X, letting users share photos, videos, and text posts, discover new content, and send direct messages.
The app was founded last year by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist, with the aim of giving users a place to “freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,” according to the
app’s website
. The team behind the app says they’re “building a platform that belongs to the people who use it — not to hidden algorithms or outside agendas.”
“UpScrolled is the foundation for a digital ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the people — not the corporations,” Hijazi says in a statement on UpScrolled’s website. “It’s more than just an alternative to Meta, X, or TikTok — it’s a reimagining of what social media should be: a space where creators, communities, and businesses thrive independently, with real control, transparency, and accountability.”
The app, available on both
iOS
and
Android
, is grappling with a surge of new users, but says it’s scaling to keep up with the demand.
According to data from the market intelligence provider
Appfigures
, UpScrolled saw approximately 41,000 downloads between Thursday, the day the TikTok deal was finalized, and Saturday, accounting for nearly one-third of its lifetime installs. UpScrolled has seen an average of about 14,000 daily downloads since Thursday, representing a 2,850% increase in daily downloads.

Claude Code&#x27;s &#x27;Tasks&#x27; update lets agents work longer and coordinate across sessions

One of the biggest constraints currently facing AI builders who want to deploy agents in service of their individual or enterprise goals is the &quot;working memory&quot; required to manage complex, multi-stage engineering projects.
Typically, when a AI agent operates purely on a stream of text or voice-based conversation, it lacks the structural permanence to handle dependencies. It knows what to do, but it often forgets why it is doing it, or in what order.
With the release of
Tasks for Claude Code (introduced in v2.1.16) last week
, Anthropic has introduced a solution that is less about &quot;AI magic&quot; and more about sound software engineering principles.
By moving from ephemeral &quot;To-dos&quot; to persistent &quot;Tasks,&quot; the company is fundamentally re-architecting how the model interacts with time, complexity, and system resources.
This update transforms the tool from a reactive coding assistant into a state-aware project manager, creating the infrastructure necessary to execute the sophisticated workflows outlined in Anthropic&#x27;s just-released Best Practices guide, while recent
changelog updates (v2.1.19)
signal a focus on the stability required for enterprise adoption.
The architecture of agency: from ephemeral to persistent
To understand the significance of this release for engineering teams, we must look at the mechanical differences between the old &quot;To-do&quot; system and the new &quot;Task&quot; primitive.
Previously, Claude Code utilized a &quot;To-do&quot; list—a lightweight, chat-resident checklist.

In early 2025, Forbes
reports
, investigators at the FBI served Microsoft with a warrant seeking the BitLocker encryption recovery keys for several laptops it believed held evidence of fraud in Guam’s COVID-19 unemployment assistance program. And Microsoft complied with the FBI’s request.
BitLocker is the name of the full-disk encryption technology that has been part of Windows for nearly two decades. Though initially only available to owners of the Pro editions of Windows who turned it on manually,
during the Windows 8 era
Microsoft began using BitLocker to encrypt local disks automatically for all Windows 11 Home and Pro PCs that signed in with a Microsoft account. Using BitLocker in this way also uploads a recovery key for your device to Microsoft’s servers—this makes it possible to unlock your disk so you don’t lose data if something goes wrong with your system, or if you install a CPU upgrade or some other hardware change that breaks BitLocker. But it also (apparently) makes it possible for Microsoft to unlock your disk, too.
A Microsoft rep said that the company handled “around 20” similar BitLocker recovery key requests from government authorities per year, and that these requests often fail because users haven’t stored their recovery keys on Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft an...</div>

Rugged mobile NAS combines touchscreen control storage and battery backup
UnifyDrive UP6 targets photographers needing fast local media transfers
Integrated UPS and offline mode support field based file work
A rugged mobile NAS with an integrated tablet-style interface has finally gone on sale after first
being announced a year ago at CES 2025
.
At $1,599, the UnifyDrive UP6 isn’t cheap, but it combines portable flash storage, networking, battery backup, and on-device processing in a single unit.
Compact and weighing about 1300g without its protective case, UP6 is primarily aimed at photographers and video creators who need fast local file backup and file management when out and about.
