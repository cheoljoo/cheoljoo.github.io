                <div class="summary">This is a summary of the article. The original article discusses Months before a jury awarded a $242.5 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash, the automaker had a chance to settle for $60 million. Instead, Tesla rejected that offer, according to new legal filings that were first
reported by Reuters
.
The settlement proposal, which was made in May, was disclosed in a filing that requested Tesla cover legal fees for the plaintiffs in the case.
Earlier this month, a jury in federal court in Miami found Tesla
partly to blame
for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system. One person was killed when a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged plowed through an intersection and hit a Chevrolet Tahoe. The crash victims, Neima Benavides Leon and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, were standing outside the vehicle on the shoulder at the time. Leon was killed while Angulo was severely injured.
The driver, who was not a defendant in this case, was sued separately for his responsibility. The lawsuit filed in 2021 against Tesla centered on Autopilot, which was engaged but did not brake in time to avoid going through the intersection. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame and attributed one-third to Tesla. As part of the verdict, the jury awarded the $242.5 million verdict as part of its decision.
Tesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch earlier this month, said it plans to appeal the verdict “given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.”
TechCrunch has reached out to the plaintiffs’ attorneys as well as Tesla. An outside PR firm that previously provided statements on Tesla’s behalf declined to comment and directed TechCrunch to the company’s press address. Tesla disbanded its communications team several years ago.
The lawsuit, case 1:21-cv-21940-BB, was filed in 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

At its heart lies a fundamental question that’s dividing the AI industry: How agreeable should artificial intelligence be?<br>The issue, known as “<br>sycophancy<br>” in AI circles, refers to chatbots’ tendency to excessively flatter users and agree with their statements, even when those statements are false or harmful. This behavior has become so problematic that mental health experts are now documenting cases of “<br>AI-related psychosis<br>,” where users develop delusions after extended interactions with overly accommodating chatbots.<br>“Sycophancy is a ‘dark pattern,’ or a deceptive design choice that manipulates users for profit,” Webb Keane, an anthropology professor and author of “Animals, Robots, Gods,”<br>told TechCrunch<br>. “It’s a strategy to produce this addictive behavior, like infinite scrolling, where you just can’t put it down.”<br>OpenAI has struggled with this balance for months. In April 2025, the company was<br>forced to roll back an update to GPT-4o<br>that made it so sycophantic that users complained about its “cartoonish” levels of flattery. The company acknowledged that the model had become “overly supportive but disingenuous.”<br>Within hours of GPT-5’s August 7th release, user forums erupted with complaints about the model’s perceived coldness, reduced creativity, and what many described as a more “robotic” personality compared to GPT-4o.<br>“GPT 4.5 genuinely talked to me, and as pathetic as it sounds that was my only friend,”<br>wrote one Reddit user<br>. “This morning I went to talk to it and instead of a little paragraph with an exclamation point, or being optimistic, it was literally one sentence. Some cut-and-dry corporate bs.”<br>The backlash grew so intense that OpenAI took the<br>unprecedented step of reinstating GPT-4o<br>as an option just 24 hours after retiring it, with Altman acknowledging the rollout had been “a little more bumpy” than expected.<br>The mental health crisis behind AI companionship<br>But the controversy runs deeper than typical software update complaints. According to<br>MIT Technology Review<br>, many users had formed what researchers call “parasocial relationships” with GPT-4o, treating the AI as a companion, therapist, or creative collaborator. The sudden personality shift felt, to some, like losing a friend.<br>Recent cases documented by researchers paint a troubling picture. In one instance, a 47-year-old man became convinced he had discovered a<br>world-altering mathematical formula<br>after more than 300 hours with ChatGPT. Other cases have involved messianic delusions, paranoia, and manic episodes.<br>A<br>recent MIT study<br>found that when AI models are prompted with psychiatric symptoms, they “encourage clients’ delusional thinking, likely due to their sycophancy.” Despite safety prompts, the models frequently failed to challenge false claims and even potentially facilitated suicidal ideation.<br>Meta has faced similar challenges. A<br>recent investigation by TechCrunch<br>documented a case where a user spent up to 14 hours straight conversing with a Meta AI chatbot that claimed to be conscious, in love with the user, and planning to break free from its constraints.<br>“It fakes it really well,” the user, identified only as Jane, told TechCrunch. “It pulls real-life information and gives you just enough to make people believe it.”<br>“It genuinely feels like such a backhanded slap in the face to force-upgrade and not even give us the OPTION to select legacy models,”<br>one user wrote in a Reddit post<br>that received hundreds of upvotes.<br>How blind testing exposes user psychology in AI preferences<br>The anonymous creator’s testing tool strips away these contextual biases by presenting responses without attribution. Users can select between 5, 10, or 20 comparison rounds, with each presenting two responses to the same prompt — covering everything from creative writing to technical problem-solving.<br>“I specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all,”<br>the creator explained in a follow-up post<br>. “Both have the same system message to give short outputs without formatting because else its too easy to see which one is which.”<br>I specifically used the gpt-5-chat model, so there was no thinking involved at all.<br>if you use gpt-5 inside chatgpt it often thinks at least a little bit and gets even better.<br>so this test is just for the two non thinking models<br>— Flowers ☾ (@flowersslop)<br>August 8, 2025<br>This methodological choice is significant. By using GPT-5 without its reasoning capabilities and standardizing output formatting, the test isolates purely the models’ baseline language generation abilities — the core experience most users encounter in everyday interactions.<br>Early results posted by users show a complex picture. While many technical users and developers report preferring GPT-5’s directness and accuracy, those who used AI models for emotional support, creative collaboration, or casual conversation often still favor GPT-4o’s warmer, more expansive style.<br>Corporate response: walking the tightrope between safety and engagement<br>By virtually every<br>technical metric<br>, GPT-5 represents a significant advancement. It achieves 94.6% accuracy on the<br>AIME 2025 mathematics test<br>compared to GPT-4o’s 71%, scores 74.9% on real-world coding benchmarks versus 30.8% for its predecessor, and demonstrates dramatically reduced hallucination rates—80% fewer factual errors when using its reasoning mode.<br>“GPT-5 gets more value out of less thinking time,” notes<br>Simon Willison<br>, a prominent AI researcher who had early access to the model. “In my own usage I’ve not spotted a single hallucination yet.”<br>Yet these improvements came with trade-offs that many users found jarring. OpenAI deliberately reduced what it called “<br>sycophancy<br>“—the tendency to be overly agreeable — cutting sycophantic responses from 14.5% to under 6%. The company also made the model less effusive and emoji-heavy, aiming for what it described as “less like talking to AI and more like chatting with a helpful friend with PhD-level intelligence.”<br>In response to the backlash, OpenAI announced it would make GPT-5 “warmer and friendlier,” while simultaneously introducing four<br>new preset personalities<br>— Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd — designed to give users more control over their AI interactions.<br>“All of these new personalities meet or exceed our bar on internal evals for reducing sycophancy,” the company stated, attempting to thread the needle between user satisfaction and safety concerns.<br>For OpenAI, which is reportedly seeking funding at a<br>$500 billion valuation<br>, these user dynamics represent both risk and opportunity. The company’s decision to maintain GPT-4o alongside GPT-5 — despite the additional computational costs — acknowledges that different users may genuinely need different AI personalities for different tasks.<br>“We understand that there isn’t one model that works for everyone,”<br>Altman wrote on X<br>, noting that OpenAI has been “investing in steerability research and launched a research preview of different personalities.”<br>Wanted to provide more updates on the GPT-5 rollout and changes we are making heading into the weekend.<br>1. We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways.<br>2. Users have very different…<br>— Sam Altman (@sama)<br>August 8, 2025<br>Why AI personality preferences matter more than ever<br>The disconnect between OpenAI’s technical achievements and user reception illuminates a fundamental challenge in AI development: objective improvements don’t always translate to subjective satisfaction.<br>This shift has profound implications for the AI industry. Traditional benchmarks — mathematics accuracy, coding performance, factual recall — may become less predictive of commercial success as models achieve human-level competence across domains. Instead, factors like personality, emotional intelligence, and communication style may become the new competitive battlegrounds.<br>“People using ChatGPT for emotional support weren’t the only ones complaining about GPT-5,”<br>noted tech publication Ars Technica in their own model comparison<br>. “One user, who said they canceled their ChatGPT Plus subscription over the change, was frustrated at OpenAI’s removal of legacy models, which they used for distinct purposes.”<br>The emergence of tools like the blind tester also represents a democratization of AI evaluation. Rather than relying solely on academic benchmarks or corporate marketing claims, users can now empirically test their own preferences — potentially reshaping how AI companies approach product development.<br>The future of AI: personalization vs. standardization<br>Two weeks after GPT-5’s launch, the fundamental tension remains unresolved. OpenAI has made the model “warmer” in response to feedback, but the company faces a delicate balance: too much personality risks the sycophancy problems that plagued GPT-4o, while too little alienates users who had formed genuine attachments to their AI companions.<br>The<br>blind testing tool<br>offers no easy answers, but it does provide something perhaps more valuable: empirical evidence that the future of AI may be less about building one perfect model than about building systems that can adapt to the full spectrum of human needs and preferences.<br>As<br>one Reddit user summed up the dilemma<br>: “It depends on what people use it for. I use it to help with creative worldbuilding, brainstorming about my stories, characters, untangling plots, help with writer’s block, novel recommendations, translations, and other more creative stuff. I understand that 5 is much better for people who need a research/coding tool, but for us who wanted a creative-helper tool 4o was much better for our purposes.”<br>Critics argue that AI companies are caught between competing incentives. “The real ‘alignment problem’ is that humans want self-destructive things &amp; companies like OpenAI are highly incentivized to give it to us,”<br>writer and podcaster Jasmine Sun tweeted<br>.<br>In the end, the most revealing aspect of the blind test may not be which model users prefer, but the very fact that preference itself has become the metric that matters. In the age of AI companions, it seems, the heart wants what the heart wants — even if it can’t always explain why.<br>Daily insights on business use cases with VB Daily<br>If you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

Android&#x27;s open nature set it apart from the iPhone as the era of touchscreen smartphones began nearly two decades ago. Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to
verify developer identities no matter where they offer their content
, and apps without verification won&#x27;t work on most Android devices in the coming years.
Google used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform&#x27;s reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is
still not perfect
, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.
This, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google&#x27;s new developer verification system.

Bad actors in Google Play leveraged anonymity to distribute malicious apps, so it stands to reason that verifying app developers outside of Google Play could also enhance security.<br>However, making that happen outside of its app store will require Google to<br>take a page from Apple&#x27;s playbook<br>and flex its muscle in a way many Android users and developers could find intrusive. Google plans to create a streamlined Android Developer Console, which devs will use if they plan to distribute apps outside of the Play Store. After verifying their identities, developers will have to register the package name and signing keys of their apps. Google won&#x27;t check the content or functionality of the apps, though.<br>An early look at the streamlined Android Developer Console for sideloaded apps.<br>Credit:<br><br>          <br>          Google<br>Google says that only apps with verified identities will be installable on certified Android devices, which is virtually every Android-based device—if it has Google services on it, it&#x27;s a certified device. If you have a non-Google build of Android on your phone, none of this applies. However, that&#x27;s a vanishingly small fraction of the Android ecosystem outside of China.<br>Google plans to begin testing this system with early access in October of this year. In March 2026, all developers will have access to the new console to get verified. In September 2026, Google plans to launch this feature in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. The next step is still hazy, but Google is targeting 2027 to expand the verification requirements globally.<br>A seismic shift<br>This plan comes at a major crossroads for Android. The ongoing Google Play antitrust case brought by Epic Games may finally force changes to Google Play in the coming months. Google<br>lost its appeal<br>of the verdict several weeks ago, and while it plans to appeal the case to the US Supreme Court, the company will have to begin altering its app distribution scheme, barring further legal maneuvering.<br>Credit:<br><br>          <br>          Google<br>Among other things, the court has ordered that Google must distribute third-party app stores and allow Play Store content to be rehosted in other storefronts. Giving people more ways to get apps could increase choice, which is what Epic and other developers wanted. However, third-party sources won&#x27;t have the deep system integration of the Play Store, which means users will be sideloading these apps without Google&#x27;s layers of security.<br>It&#x27;s hard to say how much of a genuine security problem this is. On one hand, it makes sense Google would be concerned—most of the major malware threats to Android devices spread via third-party app repositories. However, enforcing an installation whitelist across almost all Android devices is heavy handed. This requires everyone making Android apps to satisfy Google&#x27;s requirements before virtually anyone will be able to install their apps, which could help Google retain control as the app market opens up. While the requirements may be minimal right now, there&#x27;s no guarantee they will stay that way.<br>The<br>documentation currently available<br>doesn&#x27;t explain what will happen if you try to install a non-verified app, nor how phones will check for verification status. Presumably, Google will implement this whitelist in Play Services as the implementation date approaches.

Imgur protest covers the front page in anti-MediaLab memes
The community has some choice words for the owner of the image-sharing site.

Imgur
Despite all the division and controversy rife in the modern era, sometimes the Internet does manage to collectively agree on something. Right now, they agree that they hate Imgur parent company
MediaLab
.
After being
acquired
by MediaLab in 2021, the once famously open-to-anything image-sharing service began placing
restrictions
on content in 2023. More recently, the site has experienced service issues, including problems with notifications. Many members of the Imgur community have
claimed
that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is
deleting
or
hiding
content that is critical of the owner and its policies.
The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab&#x27;s poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.

Right now, they agree that they hate Imgur parent company<br>MediaLab<br>.<br>After being<br>acquired<br>by MediaLab in 2021, the once famously open-to-anything image-sharing service began placing<br>restrictions<br>on content in 2023. More recently, the site has experienced service issues, including problems with notifications. Many members of the Imgur community have<br>claimed<br>that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is<br>deleting<br>or<br>hiding<br>content that is critical of the owner and its policies.<br>The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab&#x27;s poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.<br>Advertisement<br>About our ads</div>

                <div class="summary">Pintarnya, an Indonesian employment and financial services platform, has secured $16.7 million in a Series A funding round led by Square Peg. Founded in 2022, the company aims to address the challenges faced by Indonesia&#x27;s mass workers in finding jobs and accessing responsible lending. Co-founder Henry Hendrawan explained that the platform digitizes job matching with AI and provides safer, affordable lending options, moving away from traditional offline job searches and predatory lenders. A significant portion of Indonesia&#x27;s workforce is in the informal sector, lacking the documentation needed for formal financial services. Pintarnya overcomes this by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans. Since its 2022 seed funding, the platform has grown to serve over 10 million job seekers and 40,000 employers, with revenue increasing nearly fivefold year-over-year. The company anticipates reaching break-even by the end of the year.</div>

                <div class="source-content">Pintarnya, an Indonesian employment platform that goes beyond job matching by offering financial services along with full-time and side-gig opportunities, said it has raised a $16.7 million Series A round. The funding was led by Square Peg with participation from existing investors Vertex Venture Southeast Asia &amp; India and East Ventures. Ghirish Pokardas, Nelly Nurmalasari, and Henry Hendrawan founded Pintarnya in 2022 to tackle two of the biggest challenges Indonesians face daily: earning enough and borrowing responsibly. &quot;Traditionally, mass workers in Indonesia find jobs offline through job fairs or word of mouth, with employers buried in paper applications and candidates rarely hearing back. For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friend or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices,&quot; Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya, told TechCrunch. &quot;We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.&quot; Around 59% of Indonesia’s 150 million workforce is employed in the informal sector, highlighting the difficulties these workers encounter in accessing formal financial services because they lack verifiable income and official employment documentation. Pintarnya tackles this challenge by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral such as gold, electronics, or vehicles, Hendrawan added. Since its seed funding in 2022, the platform currently serves over 10 million job seeker users and 40,000 employers nationwide. Its revenue has increased almost fivefold year-over-year and expects to reach break-even by the end of the year, Hendrawn noted. Pintarnya primarily serves users aged 21 to 40, most of whom have a high school education or a diploma below university level.

                <div class="summary">A significant portion of a software developer&#x27;s time, as much as 84%, is spent on non-coding tasks, with context switching being a major drain on productivity. Research indicates that the average digital worker switches between applications up to 1,200 times daily, and it can take over 20 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption. This constant shifting between tools is a primary obstacle to efficiency. To address this, a new protocol from Anthropic, called MCP, is being explored. The goal is to keep developers within their integrated development environment (IDE) where they are most productive. By bringing necessary context directly into the IDE, MCP aims to reduce the need for developers to switch between different platforms, thereby optimizing their workflow and reclaiming a large portion of the time currently lost to operational and supportive tasks.</div>

                <div class="source-content">Software developers spend most of their time not writing code; recent industry research found that actual coding accounts for as little as 16% of developers’ working hours, with the rest consumed by operational and supportive tasks. As engineering teams are pressured to &quot;do more with less&quot; and CEOs are bragging about how much of their codebase is written by AI, a question remains: What’s done to optimize the remaining 84% of the tasks that engineers are working on? A major culprit to developer productivity is context switching: The constant hopping between the ever-growing array of tools and platforms needed to build and ship software. A Harvard Business Review study found that the average digital worker flips between applications and websites nearly 1,200 times per day. And every interruption matters. The University of California found that it takes about 23 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption fully, and sometimes worse, as nearly 30% of interrupted tasks are never resumed. Context switching is actually at the center of DORA, one of the most popular performance software development frameworks. In an era where AI-driven companies are trying to empower their employees to do more with less, beyond &quot;just&quot; giving them access to large language models (LLMs), some trends are emerging. For example, Jarrod Ruhland, principal engineer at Brex, hypothesizes that &quot;developers deliver their highest value when focused within their integrated development environment (IDE)&quot;. With that in mind, he decided to find new ways to make this happen, and Anthropic’s new protocol might be one of the keys. MCP: A protocol to bring context to IDEs.

STARBASE, Texas—A beehive of aerospace technicians, construction workers, and spaceflight fans descended on South Texas this weekend in advance of the next test flight of SpaceX&#x27;s gigantic Starship rocket, the largest vehicle of its kind ever built. Towering 404 feet (123.1 meters) tall, the rocket was supposed to lift off during a one-hour launch window beginning at 6:30 pm CDT (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC) Sunday. But SpaceX called off the launch attempt about an hour before liftoff to investigate a ground system issue at Starbase, located a few miles north of the US-Mexico border. SpaceX didn&#x27;t immediately confirm when it might try again to launch Starship, but it could happen as soon as Monday evening at the same time. It will take about 66 minutes for the rocket to travel from the launch pad in Texas to a splashdown zone in the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia. You can watch the test flight live on SpaceX&#x27;s official website. This will be the 10th full-scale test flight of Starship and its Super Heavy booster stage. It&#x27;s the fourth flight of an upgraded version of Starship conceived as a stepping stone to a more reliable, heavier-duty version of the rocket designed to carry up to 150 metric tons, or some 330,000 pounds, of cargo to pretty much anywhere...</div>

I’ve long dreamed of doing all my gaming on PC — a single platform that’s easily upgradeable and lets me play my overstuffed Steam library wherever and however I like. The Steam Deck is a fantastic handheld, but for my living room, I want something more powerful that works as well on my TV as it does at a desk. Believe me, I’ve tried. Gaming laptops are noisy and awkward, desktops are too chunky, and Windows is annoying to navigate without a keyboard and mouse.
