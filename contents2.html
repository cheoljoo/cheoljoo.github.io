                <div class="summary">Let’s be honest, most tech wearables are bulky and not exactly what you’d describe as pretty. But when you’re regularly wearing something on your hands, you probably want it to look nice and maybe even blend in with the rest of your jewelry. That’s the idea behind Oura’s newest smart ring, the
Oura Ring 4 Ceramic
.
The Ring 4 Ceramic is Oura’s first collection of smart rings that don’t feature metallic finishes. Instead, they’re made from zirconia ceramic, a more wear-resistant ceramic, which Oura says allows for both style and comfort.
I’ve tested the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic for the past three weeks, and here’s my experience with it.
However, before we get into the specifics, it’s worth noting that since the software behind the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is the same as the Oura Ring 4, I won’t be getting too much into the software and hardware side of things. For that, you can check out our
Oura Ring 4 review
.
Finish and feel
The Oura Ring 4 comes in four colors: Midnight (dark blue), Cloud (white), Tide (light teal), and Petal (light pink). The ring costs $150 more than the starting price of the standard Ring 4, with a $500 price tag, and is available in sizes 4-15.
I opted for Midnight. Although that shade is technically dark blue, it can appear black from afar  — or even a dark shade of green, I’ve been told. The ring doesn’t look like a tech wearable at first glance, which is nice if you want to prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality.

When compared to the original Ring 4, the Ceramic version is a bit thicker, but it’s not super noticeable. The titanium version is 2.88 mm thick, while the ceramic version measures 3.51 mm.

There is a lot of enterprise data trapped in PDF documents. To be sure, gen AI tools have been able to ingest and analyze PDFs, but accuracy, time and cost have been less than ideal. New technology from
Databricks
could change that.
The company this week detailed its &quot;ai_parse_document&quot; technology, now integrated with Databricks&#x27;
Agent Bricks platform
. The technology addresses a critical bottleneck in enterprise AI adoption: Approximately 80% of enterprise knowledge remains locked in PDFs, reports and diagrams that AI systems struggle to accurately process and understand.
&quot;It&#x27;s a common assumption that parsing PDFs is a solved problem, but in reality, it isn&#x27;t,&quot; Erich Elsen, principal research scientist at Databricks, told VentureBeat. &quot;The challenge isn&#x27;t just that documents are unstructured; it&#x27;s that enterprise PDFs are inherently complex. They mix digital-native content with scanned pages and photos of physical documents, alongside tables, charts and irregular layouts, and most existing tools fail to capture that information accurately.&quot;
The hidden complexity behind document parsing
While optical character recognition (OCR) has existed for decades, Elsen argues that extracting usable, structured data from real-world enterprise documents remains fundamentally unsolved.
Key elements such as tables with merged cells, figure captions and spatial relationships between document elements are routinely dropped or misread by existing tools, making downstream AI applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems or business intelligence dashboards unreliable.</div>

I’ve been involved with the Rebelle Rally since its inception in 2016, either as a competitor or live show host, and over the past 10 years, I’ve seen it evolve from a scrappy rally with big dreams to the world-class event that it is today.
In a nutshell, the Rebelle Rally is the longest competitive off-road rally in the United States, covering over 2,000 kilometers, and it just happens to be for women. Over eight days, teams of two must plot coordinates on a map, figure out their route, and find multiple checkpoints—both marked and unmarked—with no GPS, cell phones, or chase crews. It is not a race for speed but rather a rally for navigational accuracy over some of the toughest terrain California and Nevada have to offer. There are two classes: 4×4 with vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco and X-Cross for cars like the Honda Passport and BMW X5. Heavy modifications aren’t needed, and many teams compete for the coveted Bone Stock award.
For this 10th anniversary, I got back behind the wheel of a 2025 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness as a driver, with Kendra Miller as my navigator, to defend my multiple podium finishes and stage wins and get reacquainted with the technology, or lack thereof, that makes this multi-day competition so special.</div>

IBM introduced two new quantum chips in latest step forward
The Nighthawk chip increases circuit complexity by 30% over its predecessor
Loon is IBM’s first chip to demonstrate full fault-tolerant components
IBM has announced two new quantum chips as part of its wider roadmap to achieve both quantum advantage and fault-tolerant computing by the end of the decade.
The company
says
the new Nighthawk and Loon chips mark a major leap toward making practical quantum computing a reality.
The new hardware, launched alongside advances in fabrication and software, aims to bridge the gap between experimental prototypes and commercially useful quantum systems.

Building the foundation for quantum advantage
The Nighthawk chip is designed to reach what IBM calls “quantum advantage,” the point at which a quantum computer can outperform all classical computing methods.
With 120 qubits and 218 tunable couplers arranged in a square lattice, the chip supports circuits with 30% greater complexity than its predecessor while keeping error rates low.
IBM expects the processor to handle up to 5,000 two-qubit gates initially, with future iterations scaling to 15,000 by 2028.
This performance could complement high-end

A recent Switch 2 update blocks some third-party docks, but Nintendo isn’t saying why
﻿There’s now a legal and illegal way to make Switch 2-compatible docks, apparently.

Nintendo recently issued an update (21.0.0) for its
Switch 2 console
that, in addition to
some small changes
, has caused some third-party docks to stop working as intended. In the early weeks and months of the console’s availability this summer,
companies raced
to figure out the right commands, the right power draw, and the right chips to use in order to trick the Switch 2 into thinking it had connected to the real thing — Nintendo’s dock, which is included with every console. Now, some of them will have to figure out how to do it again.
You’re not alone if you think Nintendo did this on purpose. But did it? According to Nintendo, not exactly.</div>

Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 appears to feature AI-generated art assets
The game&#x27;s Calling Cards look straight out of ChatGPT.

Add Engadget on Google
Activision Blizzard
By all appearances,
Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
features a not insignificant amount of AI-generated art,
Kotaku
reports
. The game&#x27;s
over 680 Calling Cards
— collectible backgrounds earned through in-game achievements or purchases — appear to be
the main offenders
, featuring art that imitates the knockoff animation style of
ChatGPT
.
While it&#x27;s hard to authoritatively claim that Studio Ghibli-inspired illustrations are a smoking gun, the Calling Cards players have spotted do at the very least seem unpolished for a splashy $70 game. Activision has also confirmed that the game&#x27;s development team used &quot;generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets&quot; in a disclosure on the
Black Ops 7
Steam page
, which certainly won&#x27;t dissuade anyone’s suspicions.
In a statement to
Kotaku
, Activision also didn&#x27;t deny the possibility, noting that AI was one of several &quot;digital tools&quot; it used &quot;to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players.&quot; Using AI-generated art or at least AI art edited by a human could have saved Activision and developer Treyarch money during development. But it&#x27;s also possible these in-game rewards look weird because they were made in the rush to get the game out the door.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
has the honor of being the first in the franchise to
launch on Xbox Game Pass
, one way Microsoft hopes to justify the subscription&#x27;s
recent price hike
. That the game features AI-generated assets might dampen some player&#x27;s excitement, but
Black Ops
7&#x27;s campaign
seems like the more pressing issue.</div>

                <div class="summary">Uber has quietly begun piloting in-app video recording for its drivers in India, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company. The tool is meant to deter misconduct in a market where most drivers do not use dashcams, according to Uber. Half a dozen Uber drivers in the Delhi–NCR region told TechCrunch they sometimes face misconduct from riders and, in some cases, are threatened with false complaints about their behavior — allegations that can lead to penalties or even account suspensions. “Even female passengers traveling late at night insist that we follow the route they want instead of what’s shown on the map. If we refuse, they threaten to file false complaints,” said one driver, who requested anonymity out of fear of losing his account. Drivers said the in-app video recording feature could help protect them in such situations by providing evidence when disputes arise. Still, some questioned whether Uber would back them in cases involving riders, noting that passengers pay for the trip and can easily switch to competing platforms if dissatisfied. The pilot, which began rolling out in phases in May, is now live in 10 cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Jaipur, and Lucknow, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. Riders receive an in-trip notification when video recording is active. Uber’s notification for in-app video recording

“All recordings are double-encrypted, stored on the device, and cannot be accessed by anyone — including Uber — unless a user chooses to share them as part of a safety report,” an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the recordings are automatically deleted after a week if they are not shared.

Mere hours after OpenAI updated its flagship foundation model
GPT-5 to GPT-5.1
, promising reduced token usage overall and a more pleasant personality with more preset options, Chinese search giant
Baidu unveiled its next-generation foundation model, ERNIE 5.0,
alongside a suite of AI product upgrades and strategic international expansions. The goal: to position as a global contender in the increasingly competitive enterprise AI market. Announced at the company&#x27;s Baidu World 2025 event, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary, natively omni-modal model designed to jointly process and generate content across text, images, audio, and video. Unlike Baidu’s recently released
ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking
, which is open source under an enterprise-friendly and permissive Apache 2.0 license, ERNIE 5.0 is a proprietary model and is available only via
Baidu’s ERNIE Bot
website (I needed to select it manuallyu from the model picker dropdown) and the
Qianfan cloud platform application programming interface (API) for enterprise customers. Alongside the model launch, Baidu introduced major updates to its digital human platform, no-code tools, and general-purpose AI agents — all targeted at expanding its AI footprint beyond China. The company also introduced ERNIE 5.0 Preview 1022, a variant optimized for text-intensive tasks, alongside the general preview model that balances across modalities.</div>

We got our first glimpse of the much-anticipated
second season
of
Fallout
(adapted from the popular video game franchise) in August when Prime Video released an extended teaser. We now have the official trailer, with all the deadpan humor, explosions, and mutant atrocities one could hope for—including ghoulish Elvis impersonators in New Vegas. (Spoilers for S1 below.)
As
previously reported
, in S1, we met Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), a young woman whose vault is raided by surface dwellers. The raiders kill many vault residents and kidnap her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan), so the sheltered Lucy sets out on a quest to find him. Life on the surface is pretty brutal, but Lucy learns fast. Along the way, she finds an ally (and love interest) in Maximus (Aaron Moten), a squire masquerading as a knight of the Brotherhood of Steel. And she runs afoul of a gunslinger and bounty hunter known as the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a former Hollywood actor named Cooper Howard who survived the original nuclear blast, but radiation exposure turned him into, well, a ghoul. The first season left off with Lucy deciding to join the Ghoul and the plucky dog CX404 (now named Dogmeat) to track down the leaders of Vault-Tec, revealed to have orchestrated the nuclear apocalypse—with Lucy’s father among them.</div>
