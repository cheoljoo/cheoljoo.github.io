                <div class="summary">Meta announced Wednesday that it will charge developers for running chatbots on WhatsApp in regions where regulators are forcing the company to allow them. The move comes after the company’s ban on third-party chatbots on WhatsApp took effect on January 15. For now, Meta will charge developers in Italy, where the country’s
competition watchdog asked the company to suspend its policy last December
. The company said that the new pricing for non-template responses will begin on February 16. Meta plans to charge $0.0691/ €0.0572 / £0.0498 per message to developers for AI responses. This could result in steep bills for developers if users are exchanging thousands of queries with AI chatbots every day. Earlier this month, Meta sent notices to developers creating an exemption for Italian phone numbers and allowing AI chatbots to serve those customers. At that time, the company didn’t mention any plans to charge developers. Currently, WhatsApp already charges companies for using its API for various template responses to customers, which include use cases like marketing, utility, or authentication. This includes messages users receive about payment reminders and shipping updates. “Where we are legally required to provide AI chatbots through the WhatsApp business API, we are introducing pricing for the companies that choose to use our platform to provide those services,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. This could also establish a precedent for other geographies if Meta has to cave in and allow developers to operate their chatbots. Meta first announced this past October that
it would block all third-party AI chatbots from using WhatsApp through its WhatsApp Business API
. Meta said its systems weren’t designed to handle responses from AI bots and were being strained. Techcrunch event

Factify
emerged from stealth today with
a $73 million seed round
for an ambitious, yet quixotic mission: to bring digital documents beyond the standard formats most businesses use — .PDF, .docx, collaborative cloud files like Google Docs — and into the intelligence era. For Matan Gavish, Factify’s Founder and CEO, this isn&#x27;t just a software upgrade—it is an inevitability he has been obsessed with for years. &quot;The PDF was developed when I was in elementary school,&quot; Gavish told VentureBeat. &quot;The bedrock of the software ecosystem hasn&#x27;t really evolved... someone has to redesign the digital document itself.&quot;
Gavish, a tenured professor of computer science and Stanford PhD, admits that his fixation on administrative file formats is an anomaly for someone with his credentials. &quot;It&#x27;s a very uncool problem to be obsessed with,&quot; he says. &quot;Given the fact that my academic background is AI and machine learning, my mom wanted me to start an AI company because it&#x27;s cool. I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m obsessed and then possessed by documents.&quot;
But that obsession has now attracted a sizeable seed round led by Valley Capital Partners and backed by AI heavyweights like former Google AI chief John Giannandrea. The bet is simple the static rigidity of most digital files has limited their utility, and a better, more intelligent document that actually shares its edit history and ownership with users as intended, is not only possible — it&#x27;s a multi-billion-dollar opportunity. The history of digital documents
To understand why a seed round would balloon to $73 million, you have to understand the scale of the trap businesses are in. There are currently an estimated three trillion PDFs in circulation. &quot;Some peop...</div>

Alarming critics, the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Madhu Gottumukkala, accidentally uploaded sensitive information to a public version of ChatGPT last summer, Politico
reported. According to “four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident,” Gottumukkala’s uploads of sensitive CISA contracting documents triggered multiple internal cybersecurity warnings designed to “stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks.”
Gottumukkala’s uploads happened soon after he joined the agency and sought special permission to use OpenAI’s popular chatbot, which most DHS staffers are blocked from accessing, DHS confirmed to Ars. Instead, DHS staffers use approved AI-powered tools, like the agency’s DHSChat, which “are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks,” Politico reported. It remains unclear why Gottumukkala needed to use ChatGPT.</div>

I&#x27;m still reeling from last week&#x27;s episode of
Spartacus: House of Ashur
. In my opinion,
episode 8
shocked us with the
Starz
show&#x27;s most brutal death yet, as Celadus (Dan Hamill) fell victim to the House of Proculus&#x27; newly acquired female gladiator. It&#x27;s all a plot to build up to Achillia&#x27;s (Tenika Davis) triumphant return to the arena, but now she&#x27;s lost her love and biggest cheerleader. Even worse, Tarchon (Jordi Webber) is choosing to make her life even more difficult. But can the two get it together in
