                <div class="summary">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Saturday that a recent report of friction between his company and OpenAI was “nonsense.”
Huang’s comments came after The Wall Street Journal published a story late Friday claiming that
Nvidia was looking to scale back its investment
in OpenAI. The two companies announced a plan in September in which
Nvidia would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI
and also build 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure for the AI company.
However, the WSJ said Huang has begun emphasizing that the deal is nonbinding, and that he’s also privately criticized OpenAI’s business strategy and expressed concerns about competitors like Anthropic and Google.
The WSJ also reported that the two companies are rethinking their relationship — though that doesn’t mean cutting things off entirely, with recent discussions reportedly focusing on an equity investment of a mere tens of billions of dollars from Nvidia.
An OpenAI spokesperson told the WSJ that the companies are “actively working through the details of our partnership,” adding that Nvidia “has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”
According to Bloomberg, reporters asked Huang about the report during a visit to Taipei. In response,
he insisted that Nvidia will “definitely participate”
in OpenAI’s latest funding round “because it’s such a good investment,” according to Bloomberg.
“We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang said. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.”

Most RAG systems don’t understand sophisticated documents — they shred them
Dippu Kumar Singh
January 31, 2026
CleoP made with Midjourney
By now, many enterprises have deployed some form of RAG. The promise is seductive: index your PDFs, connect an LLM and instantly democratize your corporate knowledge.
But for industries dependent on heavy engineering, the reality has been underwhelming. Engineers ask specific questions about infrastructure, and the bot hallucinates.
The failure
isn&#x27;t in the LLM
. The failure is in the preprocessing.
Standard RAG pipelines treat documents as flat strings of text. They use &quot;fixed-size chunking&quot; (cutting a document every 500 characters). This works for prose, but it destroys the logic of technical manuals. It slices tables in half, severs captions from images, and ignores the visual hierarchy of the page.
I
mproving RAG reliability isn&#x27;t about buying a bigger model; it&#x27;s about fixing the &quot;dark data&quot; problem through semantic chunking and multimodal textualization.
Here is the architectural framework for building a RAG system that can actually read a manual.
The fallacy of fixed-size chunking
In a standard Python RAG tutorial, you split text by character count. In an enterprise PDF, this is disastrous.
If a safety specification table spans 1,000 tokens, and your chunk size is 500, you have just split the &quot;voltage limit&quot; header from the &quot;240V&quot; value. The
vector database
stores them separately. When a user asks, &quot;What is the voltage limit?&quot;, the retrieval system finds the header but not the value. The LLM, forced to answer, often guesses.
The solution: Semantic chunking
The first step to fixing production RAG is abandoning arbitrary character counts in favor of document intelligence.
Using layout-aware parsing tools (such as Azure Document Intelligence), we can segment data based on document structure such as chapters, sections and paragraphs, rather than token count.
Logical cohesion:

The TV industry finally concedes that the future may not be in 8K
With virtually no content and limited benefits, 8K TVs were doomed.

Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.
In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the
first 8K TVs
started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the
first 8K TVs in the US
, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an
8K computer monitor
. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the
industry’s claim
that 8K TVs were “
the future
.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.
TV companies are quitting 8K
LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels,
FlatpanelsHD
reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative
told FlatpanelsHD
that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”
“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

Minisforum’s latest high-spec mini PC the AtomMan G7 Pro goes on sale
Core i9-14900HX and RTX 5070 power a slim aluminum chassis design
Supports up to 96GB of DDR5 memory with dual M.2 slots including PCIe 5.0 storage
Minisforum’s latest mini PC, the AtomMan G7 Pro, is
now available to buy
. The barebone version will set you back $1,359.90, down from its $1,699 MSRP, while the 32GB/1TB model with
Windows 11
Pro is $1679.90, down from $2099.
Looking more like a games console or a router than a traditional PC, the AtomMan G7 Pro&#x27;s slim aluminum chassis measures just 385 x 236 x 33mm.
It can lay flat on a desk or stand vertically with an optional base, keeping its footprint far smaller than a tower system.

It was too cold to take off my mittens and check Google Maps so I put my faith in the trickle of bundled-up people ahead of me. All of them were carrying signs and wearing whistles around their necks on top of layers and layers of winter clothing. At first there were dozens of us walking toward Government Plaza, across the street from Minneapolis City Hall, and within a block it was hundreds. By the time I arrived it was thousands. Some reports said five to ten thousand, but on the ground, it felt like a single vibrating mass that was too large to count.
I made my way through the throng, repeating “excuse me” and “pardon me” despite the din because the people here are above all else unfailingly polite. Someone offered me a “Fuck ICE“ pin. Someone else offered me a chocolate-chip cookie. Another offered me a red vuvuzela. All three declined to be named or interviewed.
