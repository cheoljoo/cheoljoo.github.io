announced what
it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure.
Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg
said that
Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to
spend billions to expand its AI capacity
. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.
On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.
“We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.”
The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers
accused
of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other
environmental concerns
. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering
questions around

In the chaotic world of Large Language Model (LLM) optimization, engineers have spent the last few years developing increasingly esoteric rituals to get better answers.
We’ve seen &quot;Chain of Thought&quot; (asking the model to think step-by-step and often, show those &quot;reasoning traces&quot; to the user), &quot;Emotional Blackmail&quot; (telling the model its career depends on the answer, or that it is
being accused of sexual misconduct
), and complex multi-shot prompting frameworks.
But a new paper released by Google Research suggests that we may have been overthinking it. The researchers found that simply repeating the input query—literally copying and pasting the prompt so it appears twice—consistently improves performance across major models including Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek.
The paper, titled &quot;
Prompt Repetition Improves Non-Reasoning LLMs
,&quot; released last month just before the holidays, presents a finding that is almost suspiciously simple: for tasks that don’t require complex reasoning steps, stating the prompt twice yields significantly better results than stating it once.
Even better, because of how transformer architecture works, this &quot;one weird trick&quot; comes with virtually zero penalty in terms of generation speed.
The Causal Blind Spot
To understand why repeating a question makes a supercomputer smarter, you have to look at the architectural limitations of the standard Transformer model.
Most modern LLMs are trained as &quot;causal&quot; language models. This means they process text strictly from left to right. When the model is processing the 5th token in your sentence, it can &quot;attend&quot; (pay attention) to tokens 1 through 4, but it has zero knowledge of token 6, because it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.

On Tuesday Microsoft
announced
a new initiative called “Community-First AI Infrastructure” that commits the company to paying full electricity costs for its data centers and refusing to seek local property tax reductions.
As demand for generative AI services has increased over the past year, Big Tech companies have been
racing
to spin up massive new data centers for serving chatbots and image generators that can have
profound economic effects
on the surrounding areas in which they are located. Among other concerns, communities across the country have grown concerned that data centers are driving up residential electricity rates through
heavy power consumption
and by
straining
water supplies due to server cooling needs.
The International Energy Agency (IEA)
projects
that global data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, reaching around 945 TWh, with the United States responsible for nearly half of total electricity demand growth over that period. This growth is happening while much of the country’s electricity transmission infrastructure is
more than
40 years old and under strain.
It’s a big enough issue that in December, US Senators
launched a probe
demanding tech companies explain how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills.

Gigabyte Z890 AORUS motherboard is capable of 256GB DDR5-7200 memory
The motherboard requires two 128GB CQDIMM modules instead of four smaller sticks
Optimized BIOS and motherboard design ensure stability at extreme memory frequencies
Gigabyte has introduced the Z890 AORUS Tachyon ICE CQDIMM Edition motherboard at CES 2026, targeting high-performance consumer applications.
The motherboard relies on two DIMM slots rather than the traditional four, which requires users to install the more expensive 128GB modules to reach a total of 256GB of memory.
The innovation centers on CQDIMM hardware combined with optimized BIOS tuning.

CQDIMM technology
The motherboard circuitry reduces memory channel load, which improves signal integrity and supports stable operation at full capacity.
The BIOS architecture manages timing, voltage, and signal synchronization, enabling DDR5-7200 frequencies even with high-capacity modules.
