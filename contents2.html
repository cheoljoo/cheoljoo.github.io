                <div class="summary">Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei discussed the complexities of the AI industry at The New York Times DealBook Summit, addressing concerns about a potential bubble and the risks companies are taking. He expressed optimism about AI&#x27;s potential but warned of &quot;timing errors&quot; and &quot;unwise risks&quot; due to uncertainty in economic value growth and the lag in building data centers. Amodei also highlighted concerns about AI chip deprecation timelines impacting industry economics, noting that new, faster, and cheaper chips can quickly devalue older ones. He mentioned Anthropic&#x27;s conservative planning despite significant revenue growth, acknowledging the high uncertainty in future projections and the dilemma of investing in compute resources.</div>

This capability addresses a bottleneck in current AI agent operations by activating specialized knowledge only when needed, rather than loading all capabilities upfront. Deepak Singh, VP of Developer Agents and Experiences at Amazon, stated the goal is to provide specialized context for faster, more cost-effective outcomes. The launch includes partnerships with nine technology companies, including Datadog, Figma, and Stripe, and allows developers to create and share their own &quot;powers.&quot;</div>

Conducted by scientists from various institutions including the UK AI Security Institute, MIT, and Stanford, the research indicates that while large language models possess vast knowledge and processing power, their persuasive capabilities in political contexts are limited.

                <div class="summary">Nuclear startup Antares secured $96 million in Series B funding ($71 million equity, $25 million debt) to advance its small modular reactor design. The round was led by Shine Capital with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, and Industrious, among others. Antares&#x27; R1 microreactor, which uses TRISO fuel (carbon- and ceramic-coated uranium spheres in graphite), targets commercial, defense, and space applications, producing 100 kilowatts to 1 megawatt of electricity.

This funding reflects a recent surge in interest and investment in nuclear power. Other companies in the sector have also seen significant capital raises: Amazon-backed X-energy recently raised a $700 million Series D round, following a $700 million Series C. Deep Fission went public via a $30 million reverse merger. Aalo Atomics raised $100 million to build a microreactor-powered data center, and Nvidia contributed to a $650 million round for TerraPower, a Bill Gates-backed SMR startup. Even large nuclear plants are experiencing a resurgence.</div>

                <div class="summary">Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced &quot;frontier agents,&quot; a new class of AI systems capable of autonomous work for hours or days without human intervention, aiming to automate the entire software development lifecycle. The announcement was made by AWS CEO Matt Garman at the re:Invent conference on December 2, 2025.

These agents include Kiro for software development, AWS Security Agent for application security, and AWS DevOps Agent for IT operations. Amazon views these as a significant leap beyond existing AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or CodeWhisperer, which require constant human interaction. Deepak Singh, VP of developer agents and experiences at Amazon, stated that frontier agents are designed for complex, multi-day challenges, allowing them to think, try solutions, and reach conclusions independently. This move highlights Amazon&#x27;s ambition to lead in developing AI systems for intricate, multi-step engineering tasks.</div>
