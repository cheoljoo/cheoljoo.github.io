                <div class="summary">The Trump administration has been talking up a potential TikTok deal this weekend, with President Donald Trump telling Fox News on Sunday that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are “probably” going to be involved.
“A man named Lachlan is involved,”
Trump said
. “Lachlan Murdoch … Rupert [Murdoch] is probably gonna be in the group, I think they’re going to be in the group.”
The president also said that Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell are likely to be involved.
While Trump did not specify whether he was talking about personal or company investments, following his comments,
Deadline reported that Fox Corp
— owner of Fox News, run by CEO Lachlan Murdoch, and long led by chairman emeritus Rupert — is in fact in talks to join the investor group backing TikTok’s U.S. spinoff from owner ByteDance.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt previously appeared on Fox News on Saturday and said that an agreement has been reached — but not signed — that would see TikTok’s U.S. operations spun out under majority American ownership.
Leavitt said Americans will hold six of seven board seats in the restructured TikTok, and the short-form video app’s algorithm will be U.S.-controlled,
according to Bloomberg
.
“So all of those details have already been agreed upon, now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,” Leavitt said.

As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the
cloud
, they’ve benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like
Microsoft
. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially
disastrous consequences
at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a
pair of vulnerabilities
in Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.
Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to
present
at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.

When I was young, ice cream was one of those treats that were limited to the times when an ice cream van came into our neighbourhood. It was once in a blue moon, and the options were pretty limited. Now that ice cream makers are more affordable than ever, anyone can make ice cream from the comfort of their own home.
The Ninja Creami includes dual-drive motors, which apply pressure and spin the paddle to ensure a creamy and consistent mix. All you have to do is add the ingredients to the bowl, and the Creami will do the rest.
If you&#x27;d like an ice cream maker that delivers soft serve options, then you&#x27;ll want the
Ninja Swirl
instead.</div>

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.
Analyst
Ming-Chi Kuo
took to X on Wednesday to claim that a
MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen
was expected to enter mass production by late 2026. Today
Bloomberg’s
Mark Gurman
is following up to remind us that he was reporting on a touchscreen MacBook Pro way back in 2023. He confirmed Kuo’s timeline was correct. Since Gurman’s
original story
, the launch date has been pushed back from late 2025, to late 2026 or early 2027.
Apple has traditionally been resistant to the idea of merging the iPad and MacBook lines, and still likely won’t do it completely. But according to Gurman iPad sales have begun to taper off, and customers increasingly expect touch-based interfaces, even on their laptops. This is in part because many Windows laptops now include touchscreens by default.</div>

Some iPhone 17 models are reportedly prone to very visible scratches
Accounts from early shoppers, coupled with a Bloomberg report, claim the Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro and the Space Black iPhone Air are showing blemishes already.

Early shoppers are taking to the web to warn about the potentially scratch-prone nature of specific iPhone 17 model and color combos. According to a
Bloomberg
report
, those demoing the latest iPhone in-store noticed that the iPhone 17 Pro in Deep Blue and the iPhone Air in Space Black models already had very noticeable scratches and scuffs. The report is backed up by social media posts following the release, where users
recorded
display models with residual marks from being used with a MagSafe charger and
showed off photos
of the back camera housing with chipped edges.
In a video by
JerryRigEverything
, the YouTuber puts the iPhone 17 models to the test with razor blades, coins and keys. The video highlights the edges of the iPhone 17 Pro&#x27;s back camera housing as particularly prone to scuffing since the colored aluminum oxide layer from the anodization process tends not to stick to sharp corners. However, the YouTuber also purposely marked up the iPhone 17 Pro blue model&#x27;s camera plateau itself and the phone&#x27;s back, which showed clear scratches that were easily wiped off.
The visibility of the scratches could be attributed to Apple&#x27;s decision to switch back from the
iPhone 16 Pro
&#x27;s titanium chassis to aluminum, which is known to be susceptible to marking. However, all of these scratches are cosmetic and won&#x27;t affect how these
latest iPhones
function. Many iPhone buyers may not even run into this issue at all, considering a majority of owners use a case.

Two of the Kremlin’s most active hacking units recently were spotted collaborating in malware attacks that compromise high-value devices located in Ukraine, security researchers said Friday.
One of the groups is Turla, which is easily one of the world’s most sophisticated advanced persistent threats (well-organized and well-funded hacking groups, many backed by nation states, that target specific adversaries for years at a time). Researchers from multiple security firms largely agree that Turla was behind breaches of
the
US Department of Defense in 2008
, and more recently, the
German Foreign Office
and France&#x27;s military. The group has also been known for
unleashing stealthy Linux malware
and using
satellite-based Internet links
to maintain the stealth of its operations
. The group conducts narrowly targeted attacks on high-value targets and keeps a low profile.
Gamaredon, meanwhile, is a separate APT known for conducting much wider-scale operations, often targeting organizations in Ukraine. Whereas Turla takes pains to fly under the radar, Gamaredon doesn’t seem to care about being detected and linked to the Russian government. Its malware generally aims to collect as much information from targets as possible over a short period of time. Both Turla and Gamaredon are widely assessed to be units of Russia’s Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the country’s chief security agency and successor of the Soviet Union’s KGB.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji
is the action role-playing game’s (RPGs) first major expansion since launch, adding a whole new island to explore, and with a refined, handcrafted focus when compared to the base game’s sprawling offering. Over ten hours or so,
Claws of Awaji
finally gives Shinobi protagonist Naoe a proper ending, and it’s an essential experience for those looking to finish off Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows’ story.
Claws of Awaji’s
opening mission sets out what’s to follow clearly and creatively. Alongside Junjiro (the Hideout&#x27;s rambunctious child), Naoe attends a puppet show, where details of the main protagonist’s long-lost Mother have started to emerge. This is when things take a turn, as you play through a 2.5D side-scrolling mission from the perspective of the mysterious Tsuyu, Naoe’s Mother, turned Master Assassin. You go from rooftops to a leap of faith into a darkened courtyard filled with enemies.
Claws of Awaji
places emphasis on the shadow-based gameplay that I found to be underutilized in the main game, as you extinguish candles and lights to close the distance on foes.
Chronicles of Tsuyu

Throughout this opening mission, I’m taken back to reflect on one of the most underrated games in the series:
Assassin’s Creed Chronicles
. This was a series of three side-scrolling vignettes set in China, India, and Russia, each focusing on a different Assassin and story.

Microsoft is raising the prices of its Xbox Series S / X consoles in the US next month. The Xbox Series X will be priced at $649.99 in the US starting October 3rd, up from its existing $599.99 price. The Xbox Series S will move to $399.99, up from $379.99.
Microsoft blames
the price hikes on “changes in the macroeconomic environment,” which is a lot of words to say:
tariffs
. Xbox console pricing outside the US will remain the same. Thankfully, pricing for controllers and headsets will remain in the same in the US.
The price rises mean Xbox Series S consoles will increase by $20, Xbox Series X consoles by $50, and the 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition Xbox Series X is increasing by $70 all the way up to $799.99.

Microsoft is making Xbox consoles even more expensive in the US
The company last raised console prices in May.

Devindra Hardawar for Engadget
Starting on October 3, Microsoft says Xbox consoles will be getting
yet another price bump
, this time ranging anywhere from a $20 increase on the company&#x27;s entry-level model to $70 for a special edition model with 2TB of storage. If all of this sounds familiar, there&#x27;s a good reason, the last time xbox prices were raised was
only a few months ago
in May.
The price increases breakdown as follows:
Xbox Series S (512GB):
$400, up $20 from $380
Xbox Series S (1TB):
$450 up $20 from $430
Xbox Series X Digital:
$600, up $50 from $550
Xbox Series X:
$650, up $50 from $600
Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition:
$800, up $70 from $730
Those are fairly significant increases, especially when you start comparing Microsoft&#x27;s higher-end Xbox Series X consoles
to the competition.
For example, the Series X Digital (which doesn&#x27;t have a disc drive) now costs $50 more than a PS5 Digital Edition. For the $800 Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition, price comparisons are even worse. It&#x27;s now more expensive than the $750 PS5 Pro, and at least Sony&#x27;s console gets you better performance for its high price.

Engadget has reached out to Microsoft for more information on the price changes. We&#x27;ll update this article if we hear back.
As of right now, Microsoft credits the need to raise prices on &quot;changes in the macroeconomic environment,&quot; which likely has to do with the impact
tariffs
implemented by the Trump administration are having on importing electronics into the US. It&#x27;s worth noting, however, that the company has also been shifting its focus away from home consoles in favor of bringing the &quot;Xbox experience&quot; to other platforms.
