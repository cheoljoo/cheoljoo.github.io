There were times at this week’s meeting of the World Economic Forum when Davos seemed transformed into a high-powered tech conference, with on-stage appearances by
Tesla CEO Elon Musk
,
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
,
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei
,
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
, and even more industry executives.
The big topic, unsurprisingly, was AI, with CEOs laying a vision for the technology’s transformative potential while also acknowledging ongoing concerns that they’re inflating a massive bubble. Amidst all that big-picture prognostication, they also found time to take swipes at their competitors, and even at their ostensible partners.
On the latest episode of
TechCrunch’s Equity podcast
, I discussed all things Davos with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec and Sean O’Kane.
Kirsten noted that the conference seemed transformed from past years, with tech companies like Meta and Salesforce taking over the main promenade, while important topics like climate change failed to draw crowds. And Sean said that even if AI execs weren’t
quite
“panhandling for usage and more customers,” it could sometimes feel that way.
Read a preview of our full conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.
Kirsten:
Some of the discussions around, let’s say, climate change or poverty and big global problems, [are] not really attracting the crowds. Meanwhile, on the main promenade in Davos, Switzerland, some of the biggest storefronts have been converted and taken over by companies like Meta and Salesforce, Tata, also a lot of Middle East countries. And I think the largest was the USA House, which was sponsored by McKinsey and Microsoft. It really felt visually different.
And then Elon Musk being there — Sean, you and I both listened to it. There wasn’t a lot of there there, but I will say that it was interesting that he showed up, because in the past he has avoided Davos.

Claude Cowork is now available to more Claude users, alongside new updates aimed at team workflows.
Anthropic made Claude Cowork accessible to users on Team and Enterprise plans, and it brings the platform closer to being a collaborative AI infrastructure. For enterprise teams, the change matters less as a feature update than as a shift in how Claude is meant to be used. Cowork reframes Claude as a shared, persistent workspace where context, files, and tasks live beyond a single user session. This aligns more closely with how teams actually operate than one-off chat interactions.
Cowork,
released earlier in January
, lets people complete non-technical tasks in the same asynchronous way they use Claude Code. It was initially limited to Claude Max subscribers.
Enterprise and Teams users who can access Claude Cowork can begin building workflows for their non-technical, or no-code, projects and even create entirely new files within the folders they have access to. However, Anthropic did not say whether Cowork projects or files are transferable between users, even within the same Enterprise or Team plan.
That uncertainty could matter for enterprises evaluating Cowork as a system of record rather than a personal productivity tool. Questions around ownership, access, and continuity — such as what happens to shared AI-generated work when an employee leaves — are increasingly central as organizations move AI into production workflows. Now that more people across Claude’s paid tiers can use Cowork, Anthropic is extending AI-assisted workflows beyond developers and into broader teams.
As more teams experiment with AI-assisted workflows, tools originally designed for coding are increasingly being repurposed for coordination, do...</div>

Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers, in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.
A cyberattack,
Reuters reported
, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.
Wipers R Us
On Friday, security firm ESET
said
the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.
“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruptio...</div>

The PRVKE is the poster child for Wandrd – being its best-selling, versatile backpack, available in three sizes and seven muted colors. I tested the mid-range 21L version of the latest V4 model, which has space for a mid-range mirrorless camera, a couple of spare lenses and accessories (in the optional cube), plus a laptop, tablet, and a few day items. For me, the big selling point is the PRVKE V4&#x27;s stylish roll-top exterior – it doesn&#x27;t scream camera bag, yet inside it can hold thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of gear, with a quick side access pocket for your camera. It&#x27;s comfortable, durable, well laid out and will likely be my primary day bag going forward.

Report reveals that OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 model cites Grokipedia
Tests conducted by the Guardian show that GPT-5.2 sourced some of its info from the AI-generated online encyclopedia from Elon Musk&#x27;s xAI.

REUTERS / Reuters
OpenAI may have called GPT-5.2 its &quot;most advanced frontier model for professional work,&quot; but tests conducted by the
Guardian
cast doubt on its credibility. According to the report, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 model cited
Grokipedia
, the online encyclopedia powered by xAI, when it came to specific, but controversial topics related to Iran or the Holocaust.
As seen in the
Guardian
&#x27;s report, ChatGPT used Grokipedia as a source for claims about the Iranian government being tied to telecommunications company MTN-Irancell and questions related to Richard Evans, a British historian who served as an expert witness during a libel trial for Holocaust denier David Irving. However, the
Guardian
noted ChatGPT didn&#x27;t use Grokipedia when it came to a prompt asking about media bias against Donald Trump and other controversial topics.
OpenAI released the
GPT-5.2 model
in December to better perform at professional use, like creating spreadsheets or handling complex tasks. Grokipedia preceded GPT-5.2&#x27;s release, but ran into some controversy when it was seen
including citations
to neo-Nazi forums. A study done by US researchers also showed that the AI-generated encyclopedia
cited
&quot;questionable&quot; and &quot;problematic&quot; sources.
In response to the
Guardian
report, OpenAI told the outlet that its GPT-5.2 model searches the web for a &quot;broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints,&quot; but applies &quot;safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms.&quot;

                <div class="summary">​If you thought 2025 couldn’t get any crazier, the streaming world had one more surprise up its sleeve before the year ended.
Netflix, already the largest streaming platform with over 325 million subscribers, took a bold step by
acquiring Warner Bros.
’ film and television studios, as well as HBO, HBO Max, and other assets. The deal, announced in early December, will bring together some of the most legendary franchises, such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and DC Comics properties, among others, all under one roof.
​The scale of this megadeal has stunned industry observers. It’s not only historic in its size but also predicted to
disrupt Hollywood
as we know it.
We’re here to break down exactly what’s happening with the Netflix–WBD deal, including the latest developments, what’s at stake, and what could come next.
What has happened so far?
​This all started back in October when WBD
revealed it was exploring a potential sale
after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.
For years, WBD has struggled under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by
declining cable viewership
and fierce competition from streaming platforms. These financial pressures forced the company to consider major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.
​The bidding process quickly became competitive. Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant. Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with
Paramount
initially viewed as the frontrunner.

Louis Columbus
January 23, 2026
Security teams are buying AI defenses that don&#x27;t work. Researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind published findings in October 2025 that should stop every CISO mid-procurement. Their paper, &quot;
The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against Llm Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections
,&quot; tested 12 published AI defenses, with most claiming near-zero attack success rates. The research team achieved bypass rates above 90% on most defenses. The implication for enterprises is stark: Most AI security products are being tested against attackers that don’t behave like real attackers.
The team tested prompting-based, training-based, and filtering-based defenses under adaptive attack conditions. All collapsed. Prompting defenses achieved 95% to 99% attack success rates under adaptive attacks. Training-based methods fared no better, with bypass rates hitting 96% to 100%. The researchers designed a rigorous methodology to stress-test those claims. Their approach included 14 authors and a $20,000 prize pool for successful attacks.
Researchers tested 12 AI defenses across four categories. All claimed near-zero attack success rates. All were bypassed at rates above 90%. Source: The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against LLM Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections, October 2025
Why WAFs fail at the inference layer
Web application firewalls (WAFs) are stateless; AI attacks are not. The distinction explains why traditional security controls collapse against modern prompt injection techniques.
The researchers threw known jailbreak techniques at these defenses.

The Trump White House yesterday posted a manipulated photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney who was arrested after protesting in a church where a pastor is allegedly also an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem
posted
what seems to be the original photo of Armstrong being led away by an officer yesterday morning. A half hour later, the official White House X account
posted
an altered version in which Armstrong’s face was manipulated to make it appear that she was crying.
“The White House shared an AI-edited photo of Nekima, depicting her in tears and scared when, in actuality, she was poised, determined, and unafraid,” NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson
said
yesterday.
Reader-added context on X said, “This photo has been digitally altered to make Nekima Levy Armstrong appear to be in distress. The Director of DHS herself posted the unedited photo in an earlier announcement.” White House Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr defended the post after criticism of the image manipulation.

Asus confirms no new phones for 2026 - leaving Zenfone and ROG lines frozen indefinitely
Smartphone profits shrink as users upgrade more slowly and hardware gains feel marginal
Chinese brands are squeezing margins, making yearly phone launches risky for smaller brands
Asus has confirmed it will stop producing new
smartphone
models, effectively freezing both the Zenfone and ROG Phone product lines.
Company CEO Jonney Shih made the statement during a recent company event in Taiwan, clarifying that no new mobile phones are planned for 2026 and beyond.
Stating, “Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future,” Shih avoided calling it a permanent exit, but its language points to an indefinite halt rather than a temporary delay.
