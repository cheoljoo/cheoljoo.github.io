New York state law takes aim at personalized pricing
New York’s latest state budget includes new disclosure requirements for businesses that use personal data to set different prices for different shoppers — for example, charging you more if you have a history of splurging.
Businesses that use personalized pricing are now required to tell customers, “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data,”
according to The New York Times
.
It’s not clear how widespread this practice actually is among online retailers. An Uber spokesperson told the NYT that the company is now showing this disclosure to New Yorkers, although they described the law as “poorly drafted and ambiguous” and insisted that Uber only uses geography and customer demand to calculate its dynamic pricing.
The National Retail Federation filed a lawsuit to stop the law, but a federal judge allowed it to move forward.
Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and now co-chair of
the mayoral transition team for Zohran Mamdani
, told the NYT that the law will be an “absolutely vital” tool for the government, but she also suggested there’s a “ton more work to be done” to regulate the practice.

Why observable AI is the missing SRE layer enterprises need for reliable LLMs
SaiKrishna Koorapati
November 29, 2025
CleoPtolemy made with Midjourney
As AI systems enter production, reliability and governance can’t depend on wishful thinking. Here’s how observability turns
large language models (LLMs)
into auditable, trustworthy enterprise systems.
Why observability secures the future of enterprise AI
The enterprise race to deploy LLM systems mirrors the early days of cloud adoption. Executives love the promise; compliance demands accountability; engineers just want a paved road.
Yet, beneath the excitement, most leaders admit they can’t trace how AI decisions are made, whether they helped the business, or if they broke any rule.
Take one Fortune 100 bank that deployed an LLM to classify loan applications.
Benchmark accuracy
looked stellar. Yet, 6 months later, auditors found that 18% of critical cases were misrouted, without a single alert or trace. The root cause wasn’t bias or bad data. It was invisible. No observability, no accountability.
If you can’t observe it, you can’t trust it. And unobserved AI will fail in silence.
Visibility isn’t a luxury; it’s the foundation of trust. Without it, AI becomes ungovernable.
Start with outcomes, not models
Most corporate AI projects begin with tech leaders choosing a model and, later, defining success metrics.
That’s backward.
Flip the order:
Define the outcome first.
What’s the measurable business goal?
Deflect 15 % of billing calls
Reduce document review time by 60 %
Cut case-handling time by two minutes
Design telemetry around that outcome,
not around “accuracy” or “BLEU score.”
Select prompts, retrieval methods and models
that demonstrably move those KPIs.
At one global insurer, for instance, reframing success as “minutes saved per claim” instead of “model precision” turned an isolated pilot into a company-wide roadmap.</div>

Around the world, some 40 million people are living with HIV. And though progress in treatment means the infection isn’t the death sentence it once was, researchers have never been able to bring about a cure. Instead, HIV-positive people must take a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives.
But in 2025, researchers reported a breakthrough that suggests that a “functional” cure for HIV—a way to keep HIV under control long-term without constant treatment—may indeed be possible. In two independent trials using infusions of engineered antibodies, some participants remained healthy without taking antiretrovirals, long after the interventions ended.
In one of the trials—the
FRESH trial
, led by virologist Thumbi Ndung’u of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa—four of 20 participants maintained undetectable levels of HIV for a median of 1.5 years without taking antiretrovirals.</div>

Although the day itself may be over for another year, there&#x27;s no shortage of
Black Friday tech deals
still going strong throughout the weekend.
Black Friday VPN deals
are no exception. Many of the biggest
VPN
providers on the planet have dropped their prices significantly this year and are still giving you the opportunity to download a bargain.
Among them is
Norton VPN
, which has guaranteed that its VPN deal – with up to 72% off and costing
as little as $2.08/£2.08 per month
– will continue to run
until Tuesday, December 2
.
And because Norton offers a generous 60-day money-back guarantee, you can strike while the pricing is hot with the confidence of knowing that you can get every cent back if you change your mind later.
You can discover all of Norton&#x27;s Black Friday VPN pricing below. Or, you&#x27;re keen to sign up straight away,

Norton VPN Standard
We retested Norton VPN in full earlier this year and were impressed with what we found. It had come on leaps and bounds since the last time we reviewed it, scoring a solid 4 stars out of 5 thanks to its &quot;fast speeds, simple apps, and impressive unblocking&quot;.
Despite being the cybersecurity company&#x27;s entry-level package, the Norton VPN Standard plan still throws in website unblocking on five devices, access to its proprietary
Mimic protocol
, privacy reassurances from its kill switch and
Double VPN and IP Rotation tools
, and an integrated ad blocker – all on top of industry-standard encryption.

I bought this $110 Nespresso rig and it’s been caffeinated bliss ever since
Is it a fancy Keurig? Yes, but I’m too lazy and cheap for a real espresso machine.

Before I went to Italy on vacation, I was fine with instant coffee and my electric kettle. I’m no coffee snob — just get that sweet caffeine into my veins as fast as humanly possible. But during that vacation, where every hotel room had a lil Nespresso machine, I suddenly became an espresso convert. “I’m going to be an annoying espresso person as soon as I get home!!,” I thought. And then I saw how much that cost to do it the “good” way.</div>

Apple’s
latest MacBook Air M4 is now discounted to $750 for
Black Friday
. The deal applies to the entry-level 13-inch model, giving you the same sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance that we praised in
our review
, now for less.
The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go.

Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks.

The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support.</div>

                <div class="summary">While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia.
It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI.
Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over
$1 billion that they’d crash
. (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “
batshit crazy
,” to which Burry responded by
mocking Karp
for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly?
Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.</div>

VentureBeat recently sat down (virtually) with Itamar Golan, co-founder and CEO of
Prompt Security
, to chat through the GenAI security challenges organizations of all sizes face.
We talked about shadow AI sprawl, the strategic decisions that led Golan to pursue building a market-leading platform versus competing on features, and a real-world incident that crystallized why protecting AI applications isn&#x27;t optional anymore. Golan provided an unvarnished view of the company&#x27;s mission to empower enterprises to adopt AI securely, and how that vision led to
SentinelOne&#x27;s
estimated
$250 million
acquisition in August 2025.
Golan&#x27;s path to founding Prompt Security began with academic work on transformer architectures, well before they became foundational to today&#x27;s large language models. His experience building one of the earliest GenAI-powered security features using GPT-2 and GPT-3 convinced him that LLM-driven applications were creating an entirely new attack surface. He founded Prompt Security in August 2023, raised $23 million across two rounds, built a 50-person team, and achieved a successful exit in under two years.
The timing of our conversation couldn’t be better. VentureBeat analysis shows shadow AI now costs enterprises
$4.63 million
per breach, 16% above average, yet 97% of breached organizations lack basic AI access controls, according to
IBM&#x27;s 2025 data
. VentureBeat estimates that shadow AI apps could double by mid-2026 based on current 5% monthly growth rates.
Cyberhaven
data reveals 73.8% of ChatGPT workplace accounts are unauthorized, and enterprise AI usage has grown 61x in just 24 months. As Golan told VentureBeat in previous coverage, &quot;We see 50 new AI apps a day, and we&#x27;ve already cataloged over 12,000.</div>

Peruse a
list of films
released in 1985 and you’ll notice a surprisingly high number of movies that have become classics in the ensuing 40 years. Sure, there were blockbusters like
Back to the Future, The Goonies, Pale Rider, The Breakfast Club
and
Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome
, but there were also critical arthouse favorites like
Kiss of the Spider Woman
and Akira Kurosawa’s masterpiece,
Ran
. Since we’re going into a long Thanksgiving weekend, I’ve made a list, in alphabetical order, of some of the quirkier gems from 1985 that have stood the test of time. (Some of the films first premiered at film festivals or in smaller international markets in 1984, but they were released in the US in 1985.)
(Some spoilers below but no major reveals.)

Have you ever had a dream, bordering on a nightmare, where you were trying desperately to get back home but obstacle after obstacle kept getting in your way? Martin Scorsese’s
After Hours
is the cinematic embodiment of that anxiety-inducing dreamscape. Griffin Dunne stars as a nebbishy computer data entry worker named Paul, who meets a young woman named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) and heads off to SoHo after work to meet her. The trouble begins when his $20 cab fare blows out the window en route. The date goes badly, and Paul leaves, enduring a string of increasingly strange encounters as he tries to get back to his uptown stomping grounds.</div>

Russian hackers exploit Blender’s Auto Run feature to deliver StealC infostealer via .blend files
Malware deployed through CGTrader assets, pulling payloads from Cloudflare Workers domains
StealC variant targets browsers, crypto wallets, chat apps, and VPN clients undetected
Blender has a convenient but risky feature which experts have found is being exploited by Russian hackers to deliver infostealer malware.
Cybersecurity researchers Morphisec observed the attacks in the wild and urged designers and other professionals to be vigilant.
Blender is a widely used
open source
3D creation suite popular among artists, animators, game developers, and studios for everything from modeling and rendering to visual effects. There is also CGTrader, a marketplace where 3D artists and designers can buy, sell, and share user-generated models and assets for their projects.

Significant impact
Now, Morphisec says it saw Russia-linked cybercriminals upload .blend files with embedded Python code onto CGTrader.
The code pulls a
malware
loader from a Cloudflare Workers domain which, in turn, pulls two ZIP archives. These deploy two payloads, including a StealC infostealer and an auxiliary Python stealer, likely as a fallback.
Obviously, the
Python code
needs to be triggered. That is where the “convenient, but risky” feature comes in.</div>
