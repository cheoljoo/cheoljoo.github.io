                <div class="summary">Kalshi, a prediction market that allows people to bet on future events, has raised a massive $1 billion round at a $11 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the deal. The round comes less than two months after the seven-year-old startup announced its previous fundraise of $300 million at a
$5 billion valuation
.
The latest round is led by the company’s returning investors Sequoia and CapitalG, the person said. Other investors in Kalshi include Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo.
Kalshi and Sequoia declined to comment. Capital G didn’t respond to our request for comment.
Kalshi’s main rival, Polymarket, was reportedly in talks last month to raise another funding round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, mere weeks after closing a $1 billion round at an
$8 billion pre-money valuation
, Bloomberg reported.
Kalshi and Polymarket surged in popularity last year after both prediction markets allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election. These betting sites became even more prominent after they correctly predicted the results of New York City’s mayoral election earlier this month.
For the Mamdani versus Cuomo race, Kalshi purchased ad space on New York subway cars, running live screens that displayed the up-to-the-minute odds of each candidate winning, a marketing campaign that undoubtedly raised the company’s brand awareness among New Yorkers.
Kalshi allows people in over 140 countries to bet on various future events, ranging from who Time Magazine will name Person of the Year for 2025 and the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film Wicked, to outcomes further in the future, like the next U.S. Presidential election winner.

Google&#x27;s upgraded Nano Banana Pro AI image model hailed as &#x27;absolutely bonkers&#x27; for enterprises and users

Infographics rendered without a single spelling error. Complex diagrams one-shotted from paragraph prompts. Logos restored from fragments. And visual outputs so sharp with so much text density and accuracy, one developer simply called it “absolutely bonkers.”
Google DeepMind’s
newly released Nano Banana Pro
—officially Gemini 3 Pro Image—has drawn astonishment from both the developer community and enterprise AI engineers.
But behind the viral praise lies something more transformative: a model built not just to impress, but to integrate deeply across Google’s AI stack—from Gemini API and Vertex AI to Workspace apps, Ads, and Google AI Studio.
Unlike earlier image models, which targeted casual users or artistic use cases, Gemini 3 Pro Image introduces studio-quality, multimodal image generation for structured workflows—with high resolution, multilingual accuracy, layout consistency, and real-time knowledge grounding. It’s engineered for technical buyers, orchestration teams, and enterprise-scale automation, not just creative exploration.
Benchmarks already show the model outperforming peers in overall visual quality, infographic generation, and text rendering accuracy. And as real-world users push it to its limits—from medical illustrations to AI memes—the model is revealing itself as both a new creative tool and a visual reasoning system for the enterprise stack.
Built for Structured Multimodal Reasoning
Gemini 3 Pro Image isn’t just drawing pretty pictures—it’s leveraging the reasoning layer of Gemini 3 Pro to generate visuals that communicate structure, intent, and factual grounding.</div>

President Trump is considering an executive order that would require the federal government to file lawsuits against states with AI laws, and prevent states with AI laws from obtaining broadband funding.
The draft order, “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” would order the attorney general to “establish an AI Litigation Task Force whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General’s judgment.”
The draft order says the Trump administration “will act to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard—not 50 discordant State ones.” It specifically names laws enacted by California and Colorado and directs the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate whether other laws should be challenged.
“That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” the draft order says.</div>

As sure as night follows day, I&#x27;m here to recommend one of my favorite
Black Friday deals
: it&#x27;s the
iPad mini on sale for $399 (was $499) at Amazon US
.
•
Shop Amazon&#x27;s full Black sale
With $100 knocked off the price of
Apple
&#x27;s smallest tablet, it&#x27;s about $20 shy of its cheapest-ever price. But don&#x27;t let that put you off, as the cash saved in this deal is ideal for splashing on a premium app collection or some games that work well on the compact tablet.

Today’s best iPad mini Black Friday deal
Save $100
Apple iPad mini 8.3-inch (A17 Pro, 2024):
was $499
now $399
at Amazon
If you&#x27;re after a smaller iPad, Amazon&#x27;s Black Friday sale has knocked a huge $100 off the price of the A17 Pro-powered iPad mini. We did see this tablet drop to $379 during Prime Day, but $399 is still an exceptional deal price. You can choose from all four colorways, and similar discounts are available on the 256GB and 512GB variants. In our
Apple iPad mini A17 Pro (2024) review
, we praised the new tablet&#x27;s &quot;pocket-friendly design&quot; and &quot;ability to support Apple Intelligence.&quot;

Anyone who&#x27;s read my articles over the past couple of years at TechRadar will probably have a good feeling for my love of the iPad mini. I&#x27;ve owned several generations of the tablet and currently use a mini with the home button-less design on a near-daily basis.
It works well as a note-taking device, e-reader, web browser, streaming machine, and even a bit of a games console. And I can count the times I&#x27;ve traveled without an iPad mini on one hand. It&#x27;s honestly such a lovely little tablet.</div>

If you’ve been waiting for some relief after Sonos raised its prices earlier this year
in response to US tariffs
, Black Friday presents a rare opportunity. With many products on sale for their lowest price to date for Black Friday, and the Sonos app being in far better shape than it was a year ago, it’s a great time to pick up a Sonos gadget.</div>

ChatGPT group chats roll out to everyone
OpenAI started testing the social feature a week ago in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan.

Add Engadget on Google
OpenAI
After what was apparently a successful testing period, OpenAI
has announced
that it is rolling out group chats in ChatGPT to &quot;all logged-in users on ChatGPT Free, Go, Plus and Pro plans globally over the coming days.&quot; The company
first started testing
a way to collaborate with peers directly inside ChatGPT around a week ago in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan.
Once you start a chat in ChatGPT you can invite other people to join (up to 20 in a chat), either with their existing ChatGPT account, or one they make after clicking the invite link. Beyond being able to prompt ChatGPT together and react to each other&#x27;s messages, the features of group chats appear to be deliberately limited. OpenAI says that the content of group chats aren&#x27;t stored in ChatGPT&#x27;s memory, and any person can be removed from a chat by any person, save for the creator.
OpenAI was
reportedly working
on its own version of a text-based social media feed in April. That X competitor has yet to materialize, but the company has brushed up against social features in other ways.

For example, the
Sora app
that OpenAI launched in September competes directly with TikTok in terms of form and its ability to provide passive entertainment. Group chats in ChatGPT might not replace an app like Messenger, but it does offer a similar AI messaging experience to what Meta&#x27;s been
playing with in Instagram
, and its using a chatbot the average person likes a lot more.

                <div class="summary">January Ventures co-founder Jennifer Neundorfer stopped by the Equity podcast during TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about fundraising in this very AI-driven market.
Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new.
“Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.”
This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same.
“Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said.
Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.”
Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21
st
Century Fox.</div>

OpenAI has
introduced GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max
, a new frontier agentic coding model now available in its Codex developer environment. The release marks a significant step forward in AI-assisted software engineering, offering improved long-horizon reasoning, efficiency, and real-time interactive capabilities. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will now replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model across Codex-integrated surfaces.
The new model is designed to serve as a persistent, high-context software development agent, capable of managing complex refactors, debugging workflows, and project-scale tasks across multiple context windows.
It comes on the heels of
Google releasing its powerful new Gemini 3 Pro model
yesterday, yet still outperforms or matches it on key coding benchmarks:
On
SWE-Bench Verified
,
GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max achieved 77.9% accuracy
at extra-high reasoning effort, edging past Gemini 3 Pro’s 76.2%.
It also led on
Terminal-Bench 2.0, with 58.1% accuracy versus Gemini’s 54.2%,
and matched Gemini’s score of 2,439 on LiveCodeBench Pro, a competitive coding Elo benchmark.
When measured against Gemini 3 Pro’s most advanced configuration — its Deep Thinking model — Codex-Max holds a slight edge in agentic coding benchmarks, as well.
Performance Benchmarks: Incremental Gains Across Key Tasks

On SWE-Lancer IC SWE, it achieved 79.9% accuracy, a significant increase from GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 66.3%. In SWE-Bench Verified (n=500), it reached 77.9% accuracy at extra-high reasoning effort, outperforming GPT‑5.1-Codex’s 73.7%.

On Monday, veteran game developer Rebecca Ann Heineman died in Rockwall, Texas, at age 62 after a battle with adenocarcinoma. Apogee founder Scott Miller first
shared
the news publicly on social media, and her son William confirmed her death with Ars Technica. Heineman’s GoFundMe page, which displayed a final message she had
posted
about entering palliative care, will now help her family with funeral costs.
Rebecca “Burger Becky” Heineman was born in October 1963 and grew up in Whittier, California. She first gained national recognition in 1980 when she
won
the national Atari 2600
Space Invaders
championship in New York at age 16, becoming the first formally recognized US video game champion. That victory launched a career
spanning
more than four decades and 67 credited games, according to MobyGames.
Among many achievements in her life, Heineman was perhaps best known for co-founding
Interplay Productions
with Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, and Troy Worrell in 1983. The company created franchises like
Wasteland
,
Fallout
, and
Baldur’s Gate
. At Interplay, Heineman designed
The Bard’s Tale III: Thief of Fate
and
Dragon Wars
while also programming ports of classics like
Wolfenstein 3D
and
Battle Chess
.

After leaving Interplay in 1995, Heineman founded Logicware and later Contraband Entertainment in 1999.</div>

Samsung
just beat
Amazon
at its own game by smashing the previous best-ever price for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 – and it’ll give you double the storage for no extra cost. That means you can get a
512GB Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for $1,399.99 at Samsung.com
– down from $2,199.99.
The previous best price we’ve seen for the Z Fold 7 was at Amazon, where the 256GB model was $1,584.99 – the retail giant currently sells the foldable for $1,599.99. This Samsung deal utterly demolishes that previous best discount, and everything else out there, so this is one you don’t want to miss.
If you have an old phone to trade in, you could snag additional cost savings of up to $1,000 – though only expect the max amount if you have something like a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra going spare.
Just note that we&#x27;ve found the page can be a little buggy and not show the deal properly. Refresh a few times, and it should show up eventually.

Today&#x27;s best Galaxy Z Fold 7 Black Friday deal
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7:
was $2,119.99
now $1,399.99
at Samsung
This is the best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal I’ve ever seen, especially when you consider Samsung isn’t just giving you a massive discount, it’s also giving you extra storage. This means more local room for photos, videos, apps, and games. It’ll be tough to beat this deal this Black Friday, so it’s one you might want to grab sooner rather than later.
