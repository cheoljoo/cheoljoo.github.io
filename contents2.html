                <div class="summary">SpaceX is reportedly lining up four major Wall Street banks for a potential 2026 IPO — a move that could signal the long-awaited reopening of the public markets after a years-long IPO drought. In the meantime, late-stage private companies like SpaceX are finding other ways to create liquidity for employees and early shareholders, largely through a fast-growing secondary market. To unpack what SpaceX’s IPO chatter means, how private liquidity works before a debut, and what investors are looking for in today’s pre-IPO giants, we spoke with Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, a broker-dealer specializing in secondary share transactions for late-stage private companies. You can listen here or wherever you get your podcasts, or read the conversation below. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Greg, welcome to the show. Before we dive in, can you share a bit about your background? I’m founder and managing director of Rainmaker Securities, which specializes in helping large late-stage, pre-IPO companies transact shares in the secondary market. I am also the founder of a secondary firm that buys private company shares called Archer Capital Group, and co-founder of Liquid Stock, a business that helps employees and executives exercise their options using their shares as collateral. I’m sure the secondaries business has been booming with this IPO drought from the past couple years. No doubt. Private companies are staying private much longer now. Many of these businesses — including SpaceX and other companies that would be top 30 in the S&amp;P 500 — would historically have gone public years ago. Techcrunch event

San Francisco-based AI lab
Arcee
made
waves last year
for being one of the only U.S. companies to train large language models (LLMs) from scratch and
release them under open or partially open source licenses
to the public—enabling developers, solo entrepreneurs, and even medium-to-large enterprises to use the powerful AI models for free and customize them at will. Now Arcee is back again this week with the release of its largest, most performant open language model to date:
Trinity Large
, a 400-billion parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE), available now in preview,
Alongside the flagship release, Arcee is shipping a &quot;raw&quot; checkpoint model,
Trinity-Large-TrueBase
, that allows researchers to study what a 400B sparse MoE learns from raw data alone, before instruction tuning and reinforcement has been applied. By providing a clean slate at the 10-trillion-token mark, Arcee enables AI builders in highly regulated industries to perform authentic audits and conduct their own specialized alignments without inheriting the &quot;black box&quot; biases or formatting quirks of a general-purpose chat model. This transparency allows for a deeper understanding of the distinction between a model&#x27;s intrinsic reasoning capabilities and the helpful behaviors dialed in during the final stages of post-training. This launch arrives as powerful Chinese open-source LLM alternatives from the likes of Alibaba (Qwen), z.AI (Zhipu), DeepSeek, Moonshot, and Baidu have flooded the market, effectively leading the category with high-efficiency architectures. Trinity Large also comes after Meta has notably retreated from the frontier open-source landscape.</div>

How far does $5,000 go when you want an electric car? You won’t be going on road trips, but a very cheap electric runabout is possible. Jonathan M. Gitlin

I’ve been thinking about used electric vehicles lately. It’s not news that EVs depreciate faster than gasoline-powered cars. All the incentives like tax credits and OEM rebates that entice the first owner to sign the paperwork are factored in by whoever wants to be the second owner. There are widespread—
if mostly ill-founded
—worries about battery longevity and having to shell out for expensive replacement packs. Technology keeps improving, which means older models will date faster. Plus, there are the usual concerns about EVs, like charging infrastructure and winter performance. So depreciate they do, and that’s good news for the three-quarters of US car buyers who buy used vehicles. It means that some very expensive EVs can now be had for quite little, but we’ll explore that more at a later date. Today, I want to focus on what you can get for peanuts. What if you wanted to only spend $5,000—or less—on an EV? As it turns out, there are options even at this end of the market. Just don’t expect that much in the way of range: We’re still a while away from a $5,000 EV
also
being an EV a sane person would want to road trip. At the same time, most of us don’t drive more than 40 miles a day, and EVs are great at sitting in traffic because there’s no engine to idle. If you’re not commuting long distances and don’t live an hour from the nearest town, a cheap EV could make sense as a runabout. Especially as they’re cheaper to run than a gas-powered car.</div>

After two years of testing digital photo frames, I&#x27;ve had the privilege of trying out many fantastic options, from budget bangers to extravagant displays. But the two that have stuck in my head recently for sheer design panache and stunning performance are the
Aura Aspen
and the
Pexar Starlight 15.6-inch. So I&#x27;ve decided to pit them against each other to see which comes out on top. Despite both being gorgeously designed, they have plenty to distinguish them from each other. The Aspen has a 4:3 aspect ratio and a 1600 x 1200 resolution, while the Starlight 15.6-inch features 16:9 with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Perhaps the most noticeable difference in their specs, though, is screen size – Pexar&#x27;s frame measures 15.6 inches while Aura&#x27;s reaches just 11.8 inches. But while the Starlight is larger, it also costs a fair bit more. The Pexar will set you back $349.99 / £259, compared to the Aspen&#x27;s $229 / £219, so you&#x27;re definitely paying for that extra screen estate. While these prices sit in the premium end of the
best digital photo frames
out there, they&#x27;re nowhere near as expensive as something like the mammoth 27-inch
Netgear Meural Canvas II
, which retails for a colossal $699.99 / £822.99.</div>

previous deadline
was just days away on February 2nd, but that date has been updated
on Google’s help page
for Fitbit account migration. The post also now specifies that, “You can still download or delete your data any time before we begin processing data deletions on July 15, 2026.” Google had already noted that Fitbit account data would be deleted, but now users have a specific timeframe for when that’s happening — and it looks like they’ll have a couple extra months to download their Fitbit data even after the new account migration deadline.</div>

Behold, the &quot;vanbulance.&quot;
(Rivian)
America’s once-promising EV transition may have
taken a U-turn
, but at least some in Hollywood are trying to do their part. Rivian partnered with
Grey’s Anatomy
to make a custom electric ambulance for the long-running series. The ambulance is a modified version of
Rivian’s Commercial Van
. The custom “vanbulance” serves a dual purpose: preventing on-set exhaust fumes (which could harm the cast and crew) and integrating a green storyline. “As an added benefit, the elimination of engine noise brought a welcome quiet while cameras were rolling,” Rivan wrote in a
blog post
. Among other modifications, it has rear double doors instead of a roll-up one. (Rivian)
The vehicle includes some production-specific touches. Its walls and roof panels are removable, allowing cameras to reach angles required for interior shots. In addition, Rivian replaced the standard van’s rear roll-up door with double doors while adding a side entry to the cargo area. The company also added custom lighting and an exterior wrap reading “Seattle Emergency Response Services.”

The team consulted with the Huntington Beach Fire Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department to inform the interior layout. “Their feedback was invaluable to understand how first responders actually use their vehicles,” Rivian wrote. At least Hollywood&#x27;s fictional worlds are transitioning to electric. (Rivian)
The Hollywood Reporter
notes
that the electric ambulance debuted in the November 13, 2025, episode of
Grey’s Anatomy
. However, it was featured more prominently in Thursday’s episode — hence Rivian choosing thi...</div>
