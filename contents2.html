                <div class="summary">Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has blocked an effort to pass legislation that would have extended data privacy protections for federal lawmakers and public officials to everyone in the United States.
On Monday night, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked the U.S. Senate for unanimous consent from fellow senators to pass his legislation,
S.2850
. Wyden’s bill, if passed, would have taken
bipartisan-passed provisions
designed to protect government officials, lawmakers, and their families from having their personal information sold or traded by data brokers, and extend them to every American and person living in the United States.
“Members of Congress should not receive special treatment,” Wyden said on the Senate floor. “Our constituents deserve protection from violence, stalking, and other criminal threats.”
“Protecting everyone is the most effective way to protect U.S. military and intelligence personnel, including undercover officers,” Wyden added, per
the congressional record
.
Cruz was the sole objecting senator, who claimed without evidence that Wyden’s bill could disrupt law enforcement, “such as knowing where sexual predators are living.”
Data brokers are part of a worldwide multibillion-dollar industry of companies that profit from hoarding and selling access to huge amounts of Americans’ personal, financial, and granular location information, often collected from phones and other devices connected to the internet. This data gets sold,
including to governments
, who don’t need a warrant for commercially obtainable data.
The collection of huge banks of data also comes with its own risks, including
security lapses
and
data breaches
. Information bought by data brokers has been used to dox people, and in recent cases linked to the recent murders of two Minnesota state lawmakers, whose killer
allegedly obtained their home addresses
from data brokers.</div>

Fresh off his crusade against Jimmy Kimmel and ABC, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission may eliminate TV station ownership limits in a potential gift for station owners like Sinclair and Nexstar.
When FCC Chairman Brendan Carr
threatened ABC affiliates with license revocations
for carrying Jimmy Kimmel&#x27;s show, he said that national networks exert too much control over local TV stations and that he&#x27;s trying &quot;to empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.&quot; Taking a cue from Carr, Sinclair and Nexstar continued blocking
Jimmy Kimmel Live!
on their ABC affiliates even after ABC and its owner Disney ended Kimmel&#x27;s suspension.
Within days, Sinclair and Nexstar decided to
put Kimmel back on the air
. Pressure from viewers and advertisers likely played a major role in the reversal. But for Carr, the episode might reinforce his belief that station groups should have more influence over national programming.
Today, Carr&#x27;s FCC
voted
to seek public comment on a
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) that could result in certain broadcast ownership limits being scrapped or changed.</div>

This innovative solar-powered dash cam could do away with awkward hardwiring for good

Baseus makes a surprising but welcome entry to dash cams

Here’s how it works
.

The Baseus PrimeTrip VD1 Pro has a tiny solar panel that powers recording while you&#x27;re parked
There&#x27;s also a battery for continuous, on-the-road recording
Complete with front 4K and rear 1080p cameras
I look after TechRadar&#x27;s dash cam coverage and have reviewed plenty of the
best dash cams
from the likes of Nextbase and
Garmin
. Thankfully, there&#x27;s still room for innovation in this space, as this week I came across the surprising Baseus PrimeTrip VD1 Pro.
The VD1 Pro has a unique trick up its sleeve: a tiny solar panel. Let&#x27;s be clear, it&#x27;s not enough to power the dash cam for continuous, on-the-road recording – there&#x27;s an internal battery for that. No, what the solar panel can do is power a parking mode for up to two weeks.
Parking modes are a relatively recent thing in dash cams. They spark to life to record the evidence when motion and threats around your parked vehicle are detected, like bumps or break-ins. Typically, they&#x27;re powered
by hardwiring to your vehicle&#x27;s battery
.

You don&#x27;t want to leave a dash cam hardwired into your parked vehicle for too long, though – eventually it&#x27;ll drain the battery completely.</div>

I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.
E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.
Editor&#x27;s note (September 2025):
Amazon announced a revamped family of
Kindle Scribe E Ink tablets
. The
Kindle Scribe 3
is thinner and lighter than its predecessor with faster page-turning and writing experiences. The
Kindle Scribe Colorsoft
is the first full-color addition to the lineup, with a pen that will support writing in 10 colors and highlighting in five different shades. Both new Scribe tablets will be available in the US &quot;later this year.</div>

                <div class="summary">Facebook is
rolling out features
that aim to bring fans closer to their favorite creators: fan challenges and customized top fan badges.
The fan challenges feature will allow creators to prompt their followers with specific challenges. Followers can  participate by making a reel or a post as a response. To encourage more engagement and participation, the particular challenge hashtag will appear in a leaderboard that ranks the submissions in order of how many reactions it gets.
These kinds of challenges have been popular on short form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, where users may participate in informal dance challenges, or riff on trending audio clips. Facebook is formalizing the trend into an actual feature by creating a landing page for specific creators’ challenges.

Meta
In one example, Facebook suggests a cooking creator could celebrate fall by inviting fans to share videos of their favorite recipes involving butternut squash.
Kalen Allen, a creator with 3.6 million Facebook followers,
tested the feature
with a challenge asking fans to make videos about their dreams and goals, yielding about 520 entries. Meta says fans have submitted 1.5 million challenge entries over the last three months, while the feature was being tested.
Facebook is also allowing creators to customize the “top fan” badges that appear next to users’ names who engage most with their content. So, instead of being designated just a “top fan” of Ed Sheeran, you can be a “Sheerio,” if that’s your thing. Other celebrities like Cardi B and J Balvin have also enabled custom badges.
Facebook generally isn’t regarded as being as creator-centric as Instagram, which recently celebrated its
3 billion monthly active user milestone
. It’s more the kind of place you’d go to read the latest drama about bike lanes in your neighborhood Facebook group, or where you’ll accidentally encounter
AI Shrimp Jesus

Google plans to begin testing its
recently announced verification scheme
for Android developers in the coming weeks, but there&#x27;s still precious little information on how the process will work. F-Droid, the free and open source app repository, isn&#x27;t waiting for the full rollout to take a position. In a blog post, F-Droid staff say that Google&#x27;s plan to force devs outside Google Play to register with the company threatens to kill alternative app stores like F-Droid.
F-Droid has been around for about 15 years and is the largest source of free and open source software (FOSS) for Android. Because the apps in F-Droid are not installed via the Play Store, you have to sideload each APK manually, and Google is targeting that process in the name of security.
Several weeks ago, Google announced plans to force all Android app developers to register their apps and identity with Google. Apps that have not been validated by the Big G will not be installable on any certified Android devices in the future. Since virtually every Android device outside of China runs Google services, that means Google is in control of the software we get to install on Android.
According to F-Droid
, Google&#x27;s verification program threatens to break free app distribution. Google claims that attaching real identities to apps reduces the incidence of malware, which it has seen in action in Google Play. Still, the Play Store is
not free of bad apps
, which F-Droid points to as evidence that Google&#x27;s moves won&#x27;t actually eliminate the risks of sideloading.

Cybercriminals exploit copyright fear to push malware into everyday online spaces
Telegram bots now double as command hubs for evolving malware threats
Fake legal firms deliver malware through takedown scams in multiple languages
Cybercriminals have long relied on fear as a way to manipulate victims, and copyright claims are proving to be one of the latest tools of choice.
Research by
Cofense Intelligence
found attackers are sending messages designed to look like legitimate takedown requests to multiple users.
However, the real intention of these messages is to deliver
malware
under the guise of legal pressure.

A campaign built on deception
The report outlined how a Vietnamese threat actor referred to as Lone None has been distributing campaigns that spoof legal firms, sending messages which claim to flag copyright-infringing content on the target’s website or social media account.
What makes this wave of activity notable is the use of multiple languages, suggesting reliance on machine translation or
AI tools
to generate convincing templates across regions.
Victims are pressured into following links, which, instead of solving an alleged copyright problem, lead to malware downloads.

Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes
only
work at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.

Reporter Marisa Kabas, founder of
The Handbasket
, posted on Bluesky today that more than
1.7 million
subscribers canceled their paid Disney streaming plans between September 17 and September 23. The total allegedly includes subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. That falloff reportedly marked a 436 percent increase over the usual churn rate for the service. We’ve reached out to Disney+ for comment on this claim.
Disney also chose to
increase subscription prices
last week, which could prolong the wave of
cancellations
. Kabas&#x27; source also
claimed
that Disney sped the return of the late night show because it had planned to announce the price hike last Tuesday.
In case you need a reminder of the entertainment news that dominated headlines for the past two weeks, Disney-owned ABC suspended the late night talk show
Jimmy Kimmel Live
on September 17 after President Donald Trump and members of his administration accused the host of making inappropriate comments regarding the assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. Although Disney then
announced
on September 22 that the program would be reinstated the following night, it seems a lot of viewers were not impressed with the company&#x27;s actions.
