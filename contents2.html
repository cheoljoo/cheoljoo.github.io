                <div class="summary">Meta announced on Monday that it’s bringing
an AI assistant
to Facebook Dating.
This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile.
Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm.
The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year growth, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about
50 million daily active users
, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users.
AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like
Sitch
have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features.
Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a
partnership
with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the
financial struggles
of Match Group, which has lost about
68%
of its stock price in the last five years.
So far, this investment has produced features like an
AI photo selector
tool to Tinder, which scans your cameral roll to help choose profile images, as well as
AI-powered matching
. Hinge has a feature that lets users
improve their responses
to profile prompts with AI.

On Monday, OpenAI and Nvidia jointly
announced
a letter of intent for a strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI&#x27;s AI infrastructure, with Nvidia planning to invest up to $100 billion as the systems roll out. The companies said the first gigawatt of Nvidia systems will come online in the second half of 2026 using Nvidia&#x27;s
Vera Rubin
platform.
&quot;Everything starts with compute,&quot; said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in the announcement. &quot;Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we&#x27;re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.&quot;
The 10-gigawatt project represents an astoundingly ambitious and as-yet-unproven scale for AI infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
told
CNBC that the planned 10 gigawatts equals the power consumption of between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, which matches the company&#x27;s total GPU shipments for this year and doubles last year&#x27;s volume. &quot;This is a giant project,&quot; Huang said in an interview alongside Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.
To put that power demand in perspective, 10 gigawatts equals the output of
roughly
10 nuclear reactors, which typically output about 1 gigawatt per facility. Current data center energy consumption
ranges
from 10 megawatts to 1 gigawatt, with most large facilities consuming between 50 and 100 megawatts.</div>

Questyle QCC Dongle Pro: Two-minute review
You may not realise it, but your phone and your wireless headphones don’t always agree on how good your music should sound. It’s a question of compatibility, and it can be a thorny issue.
Bluetooth audio codecs are the invisible lines of code that translate your music (whether streamed from a subscription service or stored locally on your phone) into something that can be transmitted wirelessly to your headphones, earbuds, or portable speakers.
All Bluetooth products support SBC, a codec that provides basic &#x27;vanilla&#x27; audio quality, but when it comes to high-quality advanced codecs, like LDAC and
aptX Adaptive
(which preserve far more of your music’s detail), it’s the wild west out there. Some Android handsets support both. Some just support one. iPhones (in fact, all
Apple
devices) support neither.</div>

Steam has taken down a game containing malware that drained the cryptocurrency wallets belonging to hundreds of players, as reported
earlier by
Bleeping Computer
. The free-to-play 2D platformer, titled
BlockBlasters
, took
more than $150,000
from victims, including $32,000 from a streamer raising funds for their cancer treatment.
In a post on X, malware tracker vx-underground revealed that bad actors targeted some streamers with a spearphishing campaign that attempted to lure victims into
promoting the game
in exchange for compensation. “Unfortunately, the Steam game was actually a cryptodrainer masquerading as a legitimate video game,” vx-underground wrote in a post on X.</div>

Perplexity Email Assistant
(Perplexity)
Perplexity has
introduced
a new feature dubbed Email Assistant. With this resource, users can direct an AI chatbot to execute basic email tasks such as scheduling meetings, organizing and prioritizing emails, and drafting replies. At launch, Gmail and Outlook are the only supported email clients.
Email assistant is only available to members of the company&#x27;s pricey Max plan, which costs $200 a month. Perplexity
added
this upscale subscription option in July. Once an Max user has signed up for the feature, they can write to Perplexity&#x27;s assistant email address to access its capabilities. Although the company emphasized that the AI assistant does not train on a user&#x27;s emails, it does adopt their writing style when drafting replies. The feature is available starting today.

                <div class="summary">The Trump administration has been talking up a potential TikTok deal this weekend, with President Donald Trump telling Fox News on Sunday that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are “probably” going to be involved.
“A man named Lachlan is involved,”
Trump said
. “Lachlan Murdoch … Rupert [Murdoch] is probably gonna be in the group, I think they’re going to be in the group.”
The president also said that Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell are likely to be involved.
While Trump did not specify whether he was talking about personal or company investments, following his comments,
Deadline reported that Fox Corp
— owner of Fox News, run by CEO Lachlan Murdoch, and long led by chairman emeritus Rupert — is in fact in talks to join the investor group backing TikTok’s U.S. spinoff from owner ByteDance.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt previously appeared on Fox News on Saturday and said that an agreement has been reached — but not signed — that would see TikTok’s U.S. operations spun out under majority American ownership.
Leavitt said Americans will hold six of seven board seats in the restructured TikTok, and the short-form video app’s algorithm will be U.S.-controlled,
according to Bloomberg
.
“So all of those details have already been agreed upon, now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,” Leavitt said.

As businesses around the world have shifted their digital infrastructure over the last decade from self-hosted servers to the
cloud
, they’ve benefitted from the standardized, built-in security features of major cloud providers like
Microsoft
. But with so much riding on these systems, there can be potentially
disastrous consequences
at a massive scale if something goes wrong. Case in point: Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema recently stumbled upon a
pair of vulnerabilities
in Microsoft Azure’s identity and access management platform that could have been exploited for a potentially cataclysmic takeover of all Azure customer accounts.
Known as Entra ID, the system stores each Azure cloud customer’s user identities, sign-in access controls, applications, and subscription management tools. Mollema has studied Entra ID security in depth and published multiple studies about weaknesses in the system, which was formerly known as Azure Active Directory. But while preparing to
present
at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas in July, Mollema discovered two vulnerabilities that he realized could be used to gain global administrator privileges—essentially god mode—and compromise every Entra ID directory, or what is known as a “tenant.” Mollema says that this would have exposed nearly every Entra ID tenant in the world other than, perhaps, government cloud infrastructure.

When I was young, ice cream was one of those treats that were limited to the times when an ice cream van came into our neighbourhood. It was once in a blue moon, and the options were pretty limited. Now that ice cream makers are more affordable than ever, anyone can make ice cream from the comfort of their own home.
The Ninja Creami includes dual-drive motors, which apply pressure and spin the paddle to ensure a creamy and consistent mix. All you have to do is add the ingredients to the bowl, and the Creami will do the rest.
If you&#x27;d like an ice cream maker that delivers soft serve options, then you&#x27;ll want the
Ninja Swirl
instead.</div>

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.
Analyst
Ming-Chi Kuo
took to X on Wednesday to claim that a
MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen
was expected to enter mass production by late 2026. Today
Bloomberg’s
Mark Gurman
is following up to remind us that he was reporting on a touchscreen MacBook Pro way back in 2023. He confirmed Kuo’s timeline was correct. Since Gurman’s
original story
, the launch date has been pushed back from late 2025, to late 2026 or early 2027.
Apple has traditionally been resistant to the idea of merging the iPad and MacBook lines, and still likely won’t do it completely. But according to Gurman iPad sales have begun to taper off, and customers increasingly expect touch-based interfaces, even on their laptops. This is in part because many Windows laptops now include touchscreens by default.</div>

Some iPhone 17 models are reportedly prone to very visible scratches
Accounts from early shoppers, coupled with a Bloomberg report, claim the Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro and the Space Black iPhone Air are showing blemishes already.

Early shoppers are taking to the web to warn about the potentially scratch-prone nature of specific iPhone 17 model and color combos. According to a
Bloomberg
report
, those demoing the latest iPhone in-store noticed that the iPhone 17 Pro in Deep Blue and the iPhone Air in Space Black models already had very noticeable scratches and scuffs. The report is backed up by social media posts following the release, where users
recorded
display models with residual marks from being used with a MagSafe charger and
showed off photos
of the back camera housing with chipped edges.
In a video by
JerryRigEverything
, the YouTuber puts the iPhone 17 models to the test with razor blades, coins and keys. The video highlights the edges of the iPhone 17 Pro&#x27;s back camera housing as particularly prone to scuffing since the colored aluminum oxide layer from the anodization process tends not to stick to sharp corners. However, the YouTuber also purposely marked up the iPhone 17 Pro blue model&#x27;s camera plateau itself and the phone&#x27;s back, which showed clear scratches that were easily wiped off.
The visibility of the scratches could be attributed to Apple&#x27;s decision to switch back from the
iPhone 16 Pro
&#x27;s titanium chassis to aluminum, which is known to be susceptible to marking. However, all of these scratches are cosmetic and won&#x27;t affect how these
latest iPhones
function. Many iPhone buyers may not even run into this issue at all, considering a majority of owners use a case.
