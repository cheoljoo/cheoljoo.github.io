Canva
launched its own design model on Thursday that understands different layers and formats today to power its features. The company also introduced new product forms, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to create with its coding tool for sheets to make widgets for getting repeatable insights.
Canva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its elements, that would generate designs with editable layers and objects as compared to a flat image. It said the model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.
“We started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you’re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,” Canva’s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call.
“What we’ve found is that where people want to be is the ability to really marry this idea of starting with a prompt and getting far, but also being able to iterate directly themselves.”
Infusing more AI features into Canva
Earlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has
a chat-like interface for generating new media
items using prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available across screens, including the design and elements tabs.

Users can also mention the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allow you to copy the art style of a design.
Earlier this year, the company added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it’s connecting these two products, allowing users to make use of data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.</div>

Why IT leaders should pay attention to Canva’s ‘imagination era’ strategy
Taryn Plumb
October 30, 2025
The rise of AI marks a critical shift away from decades defined by information-chasing and a push for more and more compute power.
Canva co-founder and CPO Cameron Adams refers to this dawning time as the “imagination era.” Meaning: Individuals and enterprises must be able to turn creativity into
action with AI
.
Canva hopes to position itself at the center of this shift with a sweeping new suite of tools. The company’s new Creative Operating System (COS) integrates AI across every layer of content creation, creating a single, comprehensive creativity platform rather than a simple, template-based design tool.
“We’re entering a new era where we need to rethink how we achieve our goals,” said Adams. “We’re enabling people’s imagination and giving them the tools they need to take action.”
An &#x27;engine&#x27; for creativity
Adams describes Canva’s platform as a three-layer stack: The top Visual Suite layer containing designs, images and other content; a collaborative Canva AI plane at center; and a foundational proprietary model holding it all up.
At the heart of Canva’s strategy is its Creative Operating System (COS) underlying. This “engine,” as Adams describes it, integrates documents, websites, presentations, sheets, whiteboards, videos, social content, hundreds of millions of photos, illustrations, a rich sound library, and numerous templates, charts, and branded elements.
The COS is getting a 2.0 upgrade, but the crucial advance is the “middle, crucial layer” that fully integrates AI and makes it accessible throughout various workflows, Adams explained. This gives creative and technical teams a single dashboard for generating, editing and launching all types of content.</div>

We’re a few weeks away from the debut of the fifth and final season of
Stranger Things
—at least the first of three parts of it—and Netflix has dropped one doozy of a trailer that shows things looking pretty bleak for our small-town heroes of Hawkins.
(Spoilers for prior seasons below.)
As
previously reported
, S4
ended with
Vecna—the Big Bad behind it all—opening the gate that allowed the Upside Down to leak into Hawkins. We’re getting a time jump for S5, but in a way, we’re coming full circle, since the events coincide with the third anniversary of Will’s original disappearance in S1. The fifth season will have eight episodes, and each one will be looong—akin to eight feature-length films. Per the official premise:
The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.</div>

Bending Spoons announces deal to buy AOL for $1.5bn
Iconic Internet provider had been part of Yahoo
Latest entry to the Bending Spoons stable - but what will it do with AOL?
For many of us, AOL is a relic of the golden age of the Internet, but it turns out the company is still alive and thriving - and is still an attractive proposition for investment.
Italian software company Bending Spoons has
revealed
AOL will be the next big addition to its portfolio, at the cost of around $1.5 billion.
AOL does still offer a web portal and an
email service
for users, and recently hit the headlines for
shutting down its dial-up internet offering
in August 2025.

AOL + Bending Spoons
Bending Spoons has snapped up a series of well-known software names in recent years, including the likes of
WeTransfer
,
Evernote
and Vimeo, and says it has no plans to shut down AOL or spin off its tools.
The company claims AOL is still one of the top ten most-used email providers in the world today, with &quot;a highly retained customer base counting around 8 million daily and 30 million monthly active users&quot;.
“AOL is an iconic, beloved business that’s in good health, has stood the test of time, and we believe has unexpressed potential,” said Bending Spoons CEO and co-founder, Luca Ferrari.</div>

Samsung’s
Galaxy Buds 3 Pro
received a decent price drop during Amazon’s October Prime Day sale, but if you held off on picking them up, your patience has been rewarded. Right now, the noise-canceling earbuds are available for around $165 ($85 off) at
Amazon
and
Best Buy
, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in months. The discount only applies to the silver color, though, and Amazon shows the deal runs through the end of today, October 30th.

Disney+ begins rolling out HDR10+ support
The image quality tech is coming to Samsung screens first.

Add Engadget on Google
Alien Earth (FX/Hulu)
Disney+ is making its first foray into HDR10+ content, but access to this content will be limited at the start. About 1,000 shows from Hulu will be available with this HDR standard, although other programming under the Disney umbrella will add support at an unspecified later date. Samsung, which is a major player behind this standard for high dynamic range video,
announced
the news. Disney+ will first offer the HDR10+ content on Samsung Crystal UHD TVs and above for models dating back to 2018, as well as select on Samsung Smart Monitors.
HDR10+ builds on the HDR10 tech for image quality. It&#x27;s an alternative to Dolby Vision, and both
technologies
offer viewers a wider range of contrast, brightness and colors on a scene-by-scene basis. (Assuming you have a screen that supports it, of course.)
Netflix
announced
the addition of HDR10+ support in March, but
a handful of platforms
have supported the standard for much longer.

                <div class="summary">geCKo Materials, the 2024 TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield runner-up, unveiled four new products at this year&#x27;s event, expanding its commercialization efforts. Founder Dr. Capella Kerst introduced a semiconductor wafer handling tool, a robotic gripper for smooth surfaces, a curved robotic &quot;end effector&quot; for irregular shapes, and an all-purpose robotic arm gripper. Inspired by lizard feet, geCKo&#x27;s dry adhesive is described as a residue-free, quick-attach/detach, and non-electrical alternative to Velcro. A one-inch tile can hold 16 pounds and endure up to 120,000 attachments, functioning for varying durations. The technology&#x27;s adaptability has attracted major clients like Ford, NASA, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Since last year&#x27;s competition, geCKo has tripled its team, secured an $8 million fundraise, and seen its adhesive used in six space missions, demonstrating its versatility across environments, including vacuums. Kerst showcased a Fanuc robotic arm utilizing geCKo tiles for object manipulation and presented videos of its commercial applications, including faster and safer semiconductor wafer movement compared to existing suction or vacuum technologies.</div>

                <div class="summary">Anysphere&#x27;s Cursor, a vibe coding platform, has launched Composer, its first proprietary coding large language model (LLM), as part of its Cursor 2.0 update. Composer is engineered for rapid and accurate coding tasks in production environments, marking an advancement in AI-assisted programming. It is already integrated into Cursor&#x27;s internal development, signifying its maturity. Cursor claims Composer completes most interactions in under 30 seconds, demonstrating strong reasoning across extensive codebases. The model is reportedly four times faster than comparable intelligent systems and is optimized for &quot;agentic&quot; workflows, where autonomous coding agents collaborate on planning, writing, testing, and reviewing code. Previously, Cursor utilized leading proprietary LLMs from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI for &quot;vibe coding,&quot; which allowed users to generate or complete code using natural language instructions; these external LLM options remain available. Composer&#x27;s performance is evaluated using &quot;Cursor Bench,&quot; an internal benchmark that assesses correctness, adherence to abstractions, style conventions, and engineering practices. On this benchmark, Composer achieves cutting-edge coding intelligence, generating at 250 tokens per second.</div>

                <div class="summary">Steven Hatfill, a senior advisor for the Department of Health and Human Services, was fired over the weekend for allegedly using a fake, inflated title and failing to cooperate with leadership. Hatfill, however, claimed his ouster was part of a &quot;coup to overthrow M. Kennedy,&quot; referring to anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and accused Kennedy&#x27;s chief of staff, Matt Buckham, of orchestrating it, though he offered no evidence. An HHS spokesperson refuted this, stating that a firing for cause does not constitute a coup. Bloomberg initially reported Hatfill&#x27;s termination. Hatfill&#x27;s role and subsequent dismissal are significant due to his history, particularly his influence in Kennedy&#x27;s decision to cancel $500 million in federal grants for mRNA vaccine development. This cancellation drew strong criticism from medical and scientific communities, who warned it would leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and allow other nations to take the lead in scientific advancements. Hatfill is known for his strong opposition to mRNA vaccine technology.</div>

                <div class="summary">AI-generated images from ChatGPT often exhibit a subtle yellow tint, a characteristic not common to all AI image generators but specific to ChatGPT. This default yellow or sepia hue can detract from image realism and make them appear dated. While the exact reason for this tint is debated—theories suggest it might be an attempt to mimic old paintings or a result of training on warm-toned images—the article focuses on how to correct it. The author demonstrates this issue with examples like a child&#x27;s birthday invitation, a Roman Gladiator cat, and a presentation image, all showing varying degrees of the yellow tone in their backgrounds. The article implies that regardless of the cause, users can learn simple color correction techniques to eliminate this &quot;Autumnal hue&quot; from their ChatGPT-generated images.</div>
