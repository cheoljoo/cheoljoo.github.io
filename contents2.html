                <div class="summary">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Saturday that a recent report of friction between his company and OpenAI was “nonsense.”
Huang’s comments came after The Wall Street Journal published a story late Friday claiming that
Nvidia was looking to scale back its investment
in OpenAI. The two companies announced a plan in September in which
Nvidia would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI
and also build 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure for the AI company.
However, the WSJ said Huang has begun emphasizing that the deal is nonbinding, and that he’s also privately criticized OpenAI’s business strategy and expressed concerns about competitors like Anthropic and Google.
The WSJ also reported that the two companies are rethinking their relationship — though that doesn’t mean cutting things off entirely, with recent discussions reportedly focusing on an equity investment of a mere tens of billions of dollars from Nvidia.
An OpenAI spokesperson told the WSJ that the companies are “actively working through the details of our partnership,” adding that Nvidia “has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”
According to Bloomberg, reporters asked Huang about the report during a visit to Taipei. In response,
he insisted that Nvidia will “definitely participate”
in OpenAI’s latest funding round “because it’s such a good investment,” according to Bloomberg.
“We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang said. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.”

Most RAG systems don’t understand sophisticated documents — they shred them
Dippu Kumar Singh
January 31, 2026
CleoP made with Midjourney
By now, many enterprises have deployed some form of RAG. The promise is seductive: index your PDFs, connect an LLM and instantly democratize your corporate knowledge.
But for industries dependent on heavy engineering, the reality has been underwhelming. Engineers ask specific questions about infrastructure, and the bot hallucinates.
The failure
isn&#x27;t in the LLM
. The failure is in the preprocessing.
Standard RAG pipelines treat documents as flat strings of text. They use &quot;fixed-size chunking&quot; (cutting a document every 500 characters). This works for prose, but it destroys the logic of technical manuals. It slices tables in half, severs captions from images, and ignores the visual hierarchy of the page.
I
mproving RAG reliability isn&#x27;t about buying a bigger model; it&#x27;s about fixing the &quot;dark data&quot; problem through semantic chunking and multimodal textualization.
Here is the architectural framework for building a RAG system that can actually read a manual.
The fallacy of fixed-size chunking
In a standard Python RAG tutorial, you split text by character count. In an enterprise PDF, this is disastrous.
If a safety specification table spans 1,000 tokens, and your chunk size is 500, you have just split the &quot;voltage limit&quot; header from the &quot;240V&quot; value. The
vector database
stores them separately. When a user asks, &quot;What is the voltage limit?&quot;, the retrieval system finds the header but not the value. The LLM, forced to answer, often guesses.
The solution: Semantic chunking
The first step to fixing production RAG is abandoning arbitrary character counts in favor of document intelligence.
Using layout-aware parsing tools (such as Azure Document Intelligence), we can segment data based on document structure such as chapters, sections and paragraphs, rather than token count.
Logical cohesion:

Technology companies spent part of the 2010s trying to convince us that we would want an 8K display one day.
In 2012, Sharp brought the first 8K TV prototype to the CES trade show in Las Vegas. In 2015, the
first 8K TVs
started selling in Japan for 16 million yen (about $133,034 at the time), and in 2018, Samsung released the
first 8K TVs in the US
, starting at a more reasonable $3,500. By 2016, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) had a specification for supporting 8K (Display Port1.4), and the HDMI Forum followed suit (with HDMI 2.1). By 2017, Dell had an
8K computer monitor
. In 2019, LG released the first 8K OLED TV, further pushing the
industry’s claim
that 8K TVs were “
the future
.”

However, 8K never proved its necessity or practicality.
TV companies are quitting 8K
LG Display is no longer making 8K LCD or OLED panels,
FlatpanelsHD
reported today. Earlier this month, an LG Display representative
told FlatpanelsHD
that the panel supplier is “taking a comprehensive view of current display market trends and the trends within the 8K content ecosystem.”
“As our technical readiness is already complete, LG Display is fully prepared to respond immediately whenever the market and customers determine that the timing is right,” LG Display’s representative said.

It was too cold to take off my mittens and check Google Maps so I put my faith in the trickle of bundled-up people ahead of me. All of them were carrying signs and wearing whistles around their necks on top of layers and layers of winter clothing. At first there were dozens of us walking toward Government Plaza, across the street from Minneapolis City Hall, and within a block it was hundreds. By the time I arrived it was thousands. Some reports said five to ten thousand, but on the ground, it felt like a single vibrating mass that was too large to count.
I made my way through the throng, repeating “excuse me” and “pardon me” despite the din because the people here are above all else unfailingly polite. Someone offered me a “Fuck ICE“ pin. Someone else offered me a chocolate-chip cookie. Another offered me a red vuvuzela. All three declined to be named or interviewed.

OnlyFans is reportedly in talks to sell a 60 percent stake to a San Francisco investment firm
Architect Capital is interested in buying a majority stake of the online platform that&#x27;s known for paid pornographic content.

OnlyFans
OnlyFans
is looking to cash out once again, but this time in a deal that would value it at several billion dollars less than a potential sale that previously fell through. As reported by
TechCrunch
,
the online platform known for subscription-based pornographic content is in talks to sell a majority stake to Architect Capital, an investment firm based in San Francisco.
According to the report, the proposed deal includes $3.5 billion in equity and $2 billion in debt, which values OnlyFans at $5.5 billion.
TechCrunch
also reported that Architect Capital and OnlyFans are currently in exclusive talks, where the website&#x27;s owner can&#x27;t negotiate with other potential buyers for a certain amount of time.
With no set timeline yet for the deal, the deal is far from an official closing. Last year, OnlyFans&#x27; owner Leonid Radvinsky was also negotiating with another investment firm, Forest Road Company, to
sell the platform
. Although that deal never went through, the talks leading up to the sale valued OnlyFans at a much higher $8 billion. The London-based website, which still doesn&#x27;t want to be known as just a
porn site
, is still growing and reported a nine percent increase in gross revenue for its 2024 fiscal year, earning more than
$7.2 billion
.

                <div class="summary">SpaceX is reportedly lining up four major Wall Street banks for a potential 2026 IPO — a move that could signal the long-awaited reopening of the public markets after a years-long IPO drought. In the meantime, late-stage private companies like SpaceX are finding other ways to create liquidity for employees and early shareholders, largely through a fast-growing secondary market. To unpack what SpaceX’s IPO chatter means, how private liquidity works before a debut, and what investors are looking for in today’s pre-IPO giants, we spoke with Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, a broker-dealer specializing in secondary share transactions for late-stage private companies. You can listen here or wherever you get your podcasts, or read the conversation below. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Greg, welcome to the show. Before we dive in, can you share a bit about your background? I’m founder and managing director of Rainmaker Securities, which specializes in helping large late-stage, pre-IPO companies transact shares in the secondary market. I am also the founder of a secondary firm that buys private company shares called Archer Capital Group, and co-founder of Liquid Stock, a business that helps employees and executives exercise their options using their shares as collateral. I’m sure the secondaries business has been booming with this IPO drought from the past couple years. No doubt. Private companies are staying private much longer now. Many of these businesses — including SpaceX and other companies that would be top 30 in the S&amp;P 500 — would historically have gone public years ago. Techcrunch event

Arcee
made
waves last year
for being one of the only U.S. companies to train large language models (LLMs) from scratch and
release them under open or partially open source licenses
to the public—enabling developers, solo entrepreneurs, and even medium-to-large enterprises to use the powerful AI models for free and customize them at will. Now Arcee is back again this week with the release of its largest, most performant open language model to date:
Trinity Large
, a 400-billion parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE), available now in preview,
Alongside the flagship release, Arcee is shipping a &quot;raw&quot; checkpoint model,
Trinity-Large-TrueBase
, that allows researchers to study what a 400B sparse MoE learns from raw data alone, before instruction tuning and reinforcement has been applied. By providing a clean slate at the 10-trillion-token mark, Arcee enables AI builders in highly regulated industries to perform authentic audits and conduct their own specialized alignments without inheriting the &quot;black box&quot; biases or formatting quirks of a general-purpose chat model. This transparency allows for a deeper understanding of the distinction between a model&#x27;s intrinsic reasoning capabilities and the helpful behaviors dialed in during the final stages of post-training. This launch arrives as powerful Chinese open-source LLM alternatives from the likes of Alibaba (Qwen), z.AI (Zhipu), DeepSeek, Moonshot, and Baidu have flooded the market, effectively leading the category with high-efficiency architectures. Trinity Large also comes after Meta has notably retreated from the frontier open-source landscape.</div>

How far does $5,000 go when you want an electric car? You won’t be going on road trips, but a very cheap electric runabout is possible. Jonathan M. Gitlin

I’ve been thinking about used electric vehicles lately. It’s not news that EVs depreciate faster than gasoline-powered cars. All the incentives like tax credits and OEM rebates that entice the first owner to sign the paperwork are factored in by whoever wants to be the second owner. There are widespread—
if mostly ill-founded
—worries about battery longevity and having to shell out for expensive replacement packs. Technology keeps improving, which means older models will date faster. Plus, there are the usual concerns about EVs, like charging infrastructure and winter performance. So depreciate they do, and that’s good news for the three-quarters of US car buyers who buy used vehicles. It means that some very expensive EVs can now be had for quite little, but we’ll explore that more at a later date. Today, I want to focus on what you can get for peanuts. What if you wanted to only spend $5,000—or less—on an EV? As it turns out, there are options even at this end of the market. Just don’t expect that much in the way of range: We’re still a while away from a $5,000 EV
also
being an EV a sane person would want to road trip. At the same time, most of us don’t drive more than 40 miles a day, and EVs are great at sitting in traffic because there’s no engine to idle. If you’re not commuting long distances and don’t live an hour from the nearest town, a cheap EV could make sense as a runabout. Especially as they’re cheaper to run than a gas-powered car.</div>

After two years of testing digital photo frames, I&#x27;ve had the privilege of trying out many fantastic options, from budget bangers to extravagant displays. But the two that have stuck in my head recently for sheer design panache and stunning performance are the
Aura Aspen
and the
Pexar Starlight 15.6-inch. So I&#x27;ve decided to pit them against each other to see which comes out on top. Despite both being gorgeously designed, they have plenty to distinguish them from each other. The Aspen has a 4:3 aspect ratio and a 1600 x 1200 resolution, while the Starlight 15.6-inch features 16:9 with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Perhaps the most noticeable difference in their specs, though, is screen size – Pexar&#x27;s frame measures 15.6 inches while Aura&#x27;s reaches just 11.8 inches. But while the Starlight is larger, it also costs a fair bit more. The Pexar will set you back $349.99 / £259, compared to the Aspen&#x27;s $229 / £219, so you&#x27;re definitely paying for that extra screen estate. While these prices sit in the premium end of the
best digital photo frames
out there, they&#x27;re nowhere near as expensive as something like the mammoth 27-inch
Netgear Meural Canvas II
, which retails for a colossal $699.99 / £822.99.</div>
