                <div class="summary">Following
an investigation by the Guardian
that found Google AI Overviews offering misleading information in response to certain health-related queries, the company appears to have removed the AI Overviews for some of those queries.
For example, the Guardian initially reported that when users asked “what is the normal range for liver blood tests,” they would be presented with numbers that did not account for factors such as nationality, sex, ethnicity, or age, potentially leading them to think their results were healthy when they were not.
Now, the Guardian says
AI Overviews have been removed
from the results for “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests.” However, it found that variations on those queries, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range,” could still lead to AI-generated summaries.
When I tried those queries this morning — several hours after the Guardian published its story — none of them resulted in seeing AI Overviews, though Google still gave me the option to ask the same query in AI Mode. In several cases, the top result was actually the Guardian article about the removal.
A Google spokesperson told the Guardian that the company does not “comment on individual removals within Search,” but that it works to “make broad improvements.” The spokesperson also said that an internal team of clinicians reviewed the queries highlighted by the Guardian and found “in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”
TechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment. Last year, the company announced
new features aimed at improving Google Search for healthcare use cases
, including improved overviews and health-focused AI models.
Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, told the Guardian that the removal is “excellent news,” but added, “Our bigger concern with all this is that it...</div>

Why your LLM bill is exploding — and how semantic caching can cut it by 73%
Sreenivasa Reddy Hulebeedu Reddy
January 10, 2026
CleoP made with Midjourney
Our LLM API bill was growing 30% month-over-month. Traffic was increasing, but not that fast. When I analyzed our query logs, I found the real problem: Users ask the same questions in different ways.
&quot;What&#x27;s your return policy?,&quot; &quot;How do I return something?&quot;, and &quot;Can I get a refund?&quot; were all hitting our LLM separately, generating nearly identical responses, each incurring full API costs.
Exact-match caching, the obvious first solution, captured only 18% of these redundant calls. The same semantic question, phrased differently, bypassed the cache entirely.
So, I implemented semantic caching based on what queries mean, not how they&#x27;re worded. After implementing it, our cache hit rate increased to 67%, reducing LLM API costs by 73%. But getting there requires solving problems that naive implementations miss.
Why exact-match caching falls short
Traditional caching uses query text as the cache key. This works when queries are identical:
# Exact-match caching
cache_key = hash(query_text)
if cache_key in cache:
return cache[cache_key]
But users don&#x27;t phrase questions identically. My analysis of 100,000 production queries found:
Only 18%
were exact duplicates of previous queries
47%
were semantically similar to previous queries (same intent, different wording)
35%
were genuinely novel queries
That 47% represented massive cost savings we were missing. Each semantically-similar query triggered a full LLM call, generating a response nearly identical to one we&#x27;d already computed.
Semantic caching architecture
Semantic caching replaces text-based keys with embedding-based similarity lookup:
class SemanticCache:
def __init__(self, embedding_model, similarity_threshold=0.92):
self.embedding_model = embedding_model
self.threshold = similarity_threshold
self.vector_store = VectorStore()
# FAISS, Pinecone, etc.
self.respon...</div>

Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world has crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s
oceans
are
absorbing
each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than in the years before.
The study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China.
A joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s
about enough
to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one
sextillion
joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
John Abraham, a professor of thermal science at the University of St. Thomas and one of the authors on the paper, says that he sometimes has trouble putting this number into contexts that laypeople understand. Abraham offers up a couple options. His favorite is comparing the energy stored in the ocean to the energy of atomic bombs: The 2025 warming, he says, is the energetic equivalent to 12 Hiroshima bombs exploding in ...</div>

It’s a new year, and that means resolving to do some things differently, but if there’s one resolution I’m not making, it’s giving up playing fun and addictive games on my phone. In this past year, I’ve spent many hours enjoying games like
Two Dots
,
SimCity BuildIt,
and
Geometry Dash Lite
. I still love those apps, but these past few weeks I’ve been hooked on the popular and extremely well-known
Crossy Road
.
All the ‘80s arcade game lovers will see it as a homage to one of the greatest games ever made, the 1981 classic video game
Frogger
. The game requires users to direct frogs to their homes by jumping on floating logs, turtles, and alligators, all the while avoiding traffic or falling in the water. If you’re interested, you can play an emulation of
Frogger over at Crazy Games
. Warning: it’s seriously addictive.
If you got distracted playing Frogger, hopefully I can turn your attention back to Crossy Road. For the uninitiated, Crossy Road is an 8-bit endless arcade hopper game where you have to guide your character of choice across freeways, railroads, rivers, and more. Sound simple? Don&#x27;t be so easily fooled!

Earlier this month,
The Guardian
published an investigation that showed Google was serving up misleading and outright false information via its AI overviews in response to certain medical inquiries. Now those results appear to have been removed. According to the
original report
:
In one case that experts described as “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.
In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.
As of this morning, the AI overviews for questions like “what is the normal range for liver blood tests?” have been
disabled entirely
. Google

California&#x27;s governor plans to set aside $200 million for state EV tax credits
Governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s budget proposal is meant to continue the momentum of EV adoption across the state.

The loss of the
federal EV tax credits
may have been a huge blow to prospective buyers, but California wants to fill that gap for its residents. Governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s proposed budget for 2026-2027, which was released on Friday, includes a &quot;light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) incentive program&quot; that details a one-time infusion of $200 million.
According to the
budget summary
, this incentive program is &quot;a critical part of the Administration&#x27;s strategy to keep ZEVs affordable and accessible for all.&quot; The proposed budget still has to make it through the state&#x27;s legislature later this year, but if passed, the new incentive would help continue the momentum of EV adoption across California. In the third quarter of 2025, the state saw almost
30 percent
of auto sales being EVs, according to the California Energy Commission.
There are no details in the budget summary outlining how exactly the $200 million would break down on a per-vehicle basis, but
USA Today
reported that the rebate would be an &quot;on the hood&quot; instant discount for EVs. Previously, buyers would get up to $7,500 back in federal tax rebates on new EV purchases and up to $4,000 on used EVs. For California&#x27;s proposed incentives, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, Lauren Sanchez, told
USA Today
that the state is still trying to figure out if it will offer tax credits for those who buy used EVs.
