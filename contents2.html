European banks plan to cut 200,000 jobs as AI takes hold
Europe’s banking sector is about to get a tough lesson about efficiency. According to a new Morgan Stanley analysis
reported
by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 European banking jobs could vanish by 2030 as lenders lean into AI and shutter physical branches. That’s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks.
The bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans. Banks are salivating over projected efficiency gains of 30%, according to the Morgan Stanley report.
The downsizing isn’t confined to Europe. Goldman Sachs had warned U.S. employees in October of job cuts and a hiring freeze through the end of 2025 as part of an AI push dubbed “OneGS 3.0” that’s targeting everything from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.
Some institutions are already swinging the axe. Dutch lender ABN Amro plans to cut a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Société Générale’s CEO has declared “nothing is sacred.” Still, some European banking leaders are urging caution, with a JPMorgan Chase exec telling the FT that if junior bankers never learn the fundamentals, it could come back to haunt the industry.

Four AI research trends enterprise teams should watch in 2026
Ben Dickson
January 1, 2026

The AI narrative has mostly been dominated by model performance on key industry benchmarks. But as the field matures and enterprises look to draw real value from advances in AI, we’re seeing parallel research in techniques that help productionize AI applications.
At VentureBeat, we are tracking AI research that can help understand where the practical implementation of technology is heading. We are looking forward to breakthroughs that are not just about the raw intelligence of a single model, but about how we engineer the systems around them. As we approach 2026, here are four trends that can represent the blueprint for the next generation of robust, scalable enterprise applications.
Continual learning
Continual learning addresses one of the key challenges of current AI models: teaching them new information and skills without destroying their existing knowledge (often referred to as “
catastrophic forgetting
”).
Traditionally, there are two ways to solve this. One is to retrain the model with a mix of old and new information, which is expensive, time-consuming, and extremely complicated. This makes it inaccessible to most companies using models.
Another workaround is to provide models with in-context information through techniques such as RAG. However, these techniques do not update the model’s internal knowledge, which can prove problematic as you move away from the model’s knowledge cutoff and facts start conflicting with what was true at the time of the model’s training. They also require a lot of engineering and are limited by the context windows of the models.
Continual learning enables models to update their internal knowledge without the need for retraining. Google has been working on this with several new model architectures. One of them is
Titans
, which proposes a different primitive: a learned long-term memory module that lets the system incorporate historical context at inference time. Intuitively, it shifts some “learning” from offline weight updates into an online memory process, closer to how teams already think about caches, indexes, and logs.
Hope (left) uses multiple levels of nested learning while Transformers (right) only interacts between the attention and feed-forward networks (source: Google)
Nested Learning
pushes the same theme from another angle. It treats a model as a set of nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, and uses that framing to address catastrophic forgetting.
Standard transformer-based language models have dense layers that store the long-term memory obtained during pretraining and attention layers that hold the immediate context. Nested Learning introduces a “continuum memory system,” where memory is seen as a spectrum of modules that update at different frequencies. This creates a memory system that is more attuned to continual learning.
Continual learning is complementary to the work being done on giving agents short-term memory through context engineering. As it matures, enterprises can expect a generation of models that adapt to changing environments, dynamically deciding which new information to internalize and which to preserve in short-term memory.
World models
World models promise to give AI systems the ability to understand their environments without the need for human-labeled data or human-generated text. With world models, AI systems can better respond to unpredictable and out-of-distribution events and become more robust against the uncertainty of the real world.
More importantly, world models open the way for AI systems that can move beyond text and solve tasks that involve physical environments. World models try to learn the regularities of the physical world directly from observation and interaction.
There are different approaches for creating world models. DeepMind is building
Genie
, a family of generative end-to-end models that simulate an environment so an agent can predict how the environment will evolve and how actions will change it. It takes in an image or prompt along with user actions and generates the sequence of video frames that reflect how the world changes. Genie can create interactive environments that can be used for different purposes, including training robots and self-driving cars.
World Labs
, a new startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, takes a slightly different approach. Marble, World Labs’ first AI system, uses generative AI to create a 3D model from an image or a prompt, which can then be used by a physics and 3D engine to render and simulate the interactive environment used to train robots.
V-JEPA architecture (source: Meta FAIR)
Another approach is the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) espoused by Turing Award winner and former Meta AI Chief Yann LeCun. JEPA models learn latent representations from raw data so the system can anticipate what comes next without generating every pixel.
JEPA models are much more efficient than generative models, which makes them suitable for fast-paced real-time AI applications that need to run on resource constrained devices.
V-JEPA
, the video version of the architecture, is pre-trained on unlabeled internet-scale video to learn world models through observation. It then adds a small amount of interaction data from robot trajectories to support planning. That combination hints at a path where enterprises leverage abundant passive video (training, inspection, dashcams, retail) and add limited, high-value interaction data where they need control.
In November,
LeCun confirmed that he will be leaving Meta
and will be starting a new AI startup that will pursue “systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.”
Orchestration
Frontier LLMs continue to advance on very challenging benchmarks, often outperforming human experts. But when it comes to real-world tasks and multi-step agentic workflows, even strong models fail: They lose context, call tools with the wrong parameters, and compound small mistakes.
Orchestration treats those failures as systems problems that can be addressed with the right scaffolding and engineering. For example, a router chooses between a fast small model, a bigger model for harder steps, retrieval for grounding, and deterministic tools for actions.
There are now multiple frameworks that create orchestration layers to improve efficiency and accuracy of AI agents, especially when using external tools. Stanford&#x27;s
OctoTools
is an open-source framework that can orchestrate multiple tools without the need to fine-tune or adjust the models. OctoTools uses a modular approach that plans a solution, selects tools, and passes subtasks to different agents. OctoTools can use any general-purpose LLM as its backbone.
ToolOrchestra framework (source: arXiv)
Another approach is to train a specialized orchestrator model that can divide labor between different components of the AI system. One such example is Nvidia’s
Orchestrator
, an 8-billion-parameter model that coordinates different tools and LLMs to solve complex problems. Orchestrator was trained through a special reinforcement learning technique designed for model orchestration. It can tell when to use tools, when to delegate tasks to small specialized models, and when to use the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of large generalist models.
One of the characteristics of these and other similar frameworks is that they can benefit from advances in the underlying models. So as we continue to see advances in frontier models, we can expect orchestration frameworks to evolve and help enterprises build robust and resource-efficient agentic applications.
Refinement
Refinement techniques turn “one answer” into a controlled process: propose, critique, revise, and verify. It frames the workflow as using the same model to generate an initial output, produce feedback on it, and iteratively improve, without additional training.
While self-refinement techniques have been around for a few years, we might be at a point where we can see them provide a step change in agentic applications. This was put on full display in the results of the ARC Prize, which dubbed 2025 as the “
Year of the Refinement Loop
” and wrote, “From an information theory perspective, refinement is intelligence.”
ARC tests models on complicated abstract reasoning puzzles. ARC’s own analysis reports that the top verified refinement solution, built on a frontier model and
developed by Poetiq
, reached 54% on ARC-AGI-2, beating the runner-up, Gemini 3 Deep Think (45%), at half the price.
Poetiq’s solution is a recursive, self-improving, system that is LLM-agnostic. It is designed to leverage the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of the underlying model to reflect and refine its own solution and invoke tools such as code interpreters when needed.
As models become stronger, adding self-refinement layers will make it possible to get more out of them. Poetiq is already working with partners to adapt its meta-system to “handle complex real-world problems that frontier models struggle to solve.”
How to track AI research in 2026
A practical way to read the research in the coming year is to watch which new techniques can help enterprises move agentic applications from proof-of-concepts into scalable systems.
Continual learning shifts rigor toward memory provenance and retention. World models shift it toward robust simulation and prediction of real-world events. Orchestration shifts it toward better use of resources. Refinement shifts it toward smart reflection and correction of answers.
The winners will not only pick strong models, they will build the control plane that keeps those models correct, current, and cost-efficient.

Four AI research trends enterprise teams should watch in 2026
Ben Dickson

The AI narrative has mostly been dominated by model performance on key industry benchmarks. But as the field matures and enterprises look to draw real value from advances in AI, we’re seeing parallel research in techniques that help productionize AI applications.
At VentureBeat, we are tracking AI research that can help understand where the practical implementation of technology is heading. We are looking forward to breakthroughs that are not just about the raw intelligence of a single model, but about how we engineer the systems around them. As we approach 2026, here are four trends that can represent the blueprint for the next generation of robust, scalable enterprise applications.
Continual learning
Continual learning addresses one of the key challenges of current AI models: teaching them new information and skills without destroying their existing knowledge (often referred to as “
catastrophic forgetting
”).
Traditionally, there are two ways to solve this. One is to retrain the model with a mix of old and new information, which is expensive, time-consuming, and extremely complicated. This makes it inaccessible to most companies using models.
Another workaround is to provide models with in-context information through techniques such as RAG. However, these techniques do not update the model’s internal knowledge, which can prove problematic as you move away from the model’s knowledge cutoff and facts start conflicting with what was true at the time of the model’s training. They also require a lot of engineering and are limited by the context windows of the models.
Continual learning enables models to update their internal knowledge without the need for retraining. Google has been working on this with several new model architectures. One of them is
Titans
, which proposes a different primitive: a learned long-term memory module that lets the system incorporate historical context at inference time. Intuitively, it shifts some “learning” from offline weight updates into an online memory process, closer to how teams already think about caches, indexes, and logs.
Hope (left) uses multiple levels of nested learning while Transformers (right) only interacts between the attention and feed-forward networks (source: Google)
Nested Learning
pushes the same theme from another angle. It treats a model as a set of nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, and uses that framing to address catastrophic forgetting.
Standard transformer-based language models have dense layers that store the long-term memory obtained during pretraining and attention layers that hold the immediate context. Nested Learning introduces a “continuum memory system,” where memory is seen as a spectrum of modules that update at different frequencies. This creates a memory system that is more attuned to continual learning.
Continual learning is complementary to the work being done on giving agents short-term memory through context engineering. As it matures, enterprises can expect a generation of models that adapt to changing environments, dynamically deciding which new information to internalize and which to preserve in short-term memory.
World models
World models promise to give AI systems the ability to understand their environments without the need for human-labeled data or human-generated text. With world models, AI systems can better respond to unpredictable and out-of-distribution events and become more robust against the uncertainty of the real world.
More importantly, world models open the way for AI systems that can move beyond text and solve tasks that involve physical environments. World models try to learn the regularities of the physical world directly from observation and interaction.
There are different approaches for creating world models. DeepMind is building
Genie
, a family of generative end-to-end models that simulate an environment so an agent can predict how the environment will evolve and how actions will change it. It takes in an image or prompt along with user actions and generates the sequence of video frames that reflect how the world changes. Genie can create interactive environments that can be used for different purposes, including training robots and self-driving cars.
World Labs
, a new startup founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, takes a slightly different approach. Marble, World Labs’ first AI system, uses generative AI to create a 3D model from an image or a prompt, which can then be used by a physics and 3D engine to render and simulate the interactive environment used to train robots.
V-JEPA architecture (source: Meta FAIR)
Another approach is the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) espoused by Turing Award winner and former Meta AI Chief Yann LeCun. JEPA models learn latent representations from raw data so the system can anticipate what comes next without generating every pixel.
JEPA models are much more efficient than generative models, which makes them suitable for fast-paced real-time AI applications that need to run on resource constrained devices.
V-JEPA
, the video version of the architecture, is pre-trained on unlabeled internet-scale video to learn world models through observation. It then adds a small amount of interaction data from robot trajectories to support planning. That combination hints at a path where enterprises leverage abundant passive video (training, inspection, dashcams, retail) and add limited, high-value interaction data where they need control.
In November,
LeCun confirmed that he will be leaving Meta
and will be starting a new AI startup that will pursue “systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.”
Orchestration
Frontier LLMs continue to advance on very challenging benchmarks, often outperforming human experts. But when it comes to real-world tasks and multi-step agentic workflows, even strong models fail: They lose context, call tools with the wrong parameters, and compound small mistakes.
Orchestration treats those failures as systems problems that can be addressed with the right scaffolding and engineering. For example, a router chooses between a fast small model, a bigger model for harder steps, retrieval for grounding, and deterministic tools for actions.
There are now multiple frameworks that create orchestration layers to improve efficiency and accuracy of AI agents, especially when using external tools. Stanford&#x27;s
OctoTools
is an open-source framework that can orchestrate multiple tools without the need to fine-tune or adjust the models. OctoTools uses a modular approach that plans a solution, selects tools, and passes subtasks to different agents. OctoTools can use any general-purpose LLM as its backbone.
ToolOrchestra framework (source: arXiv)
Another approach is to train a specialized orchestrator model that can divide labor between different components of the AI system. One such example is Nvidia’s
Orchestrator
, an 8-billion-parameter model that coordinates different tools and LLMs to solve complex problems. Orchestrator was trained through a special reinforcement learning technique designed for model orchestration. It can tell when to use tools, when to delegate tasks to small specialized models, and when to use the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of large generalist models.
One of the characteristics of these and other similar frameworks is that they can benefit from advances in the underlying models. So as we continue to see advances in frontier models, we can expect orchestration frameworks to evolve and help enterprises build robust and resource-efficient agentic applications.
Refinement
Refinement techniques turn “one answer” into a controlled process: propose, critique, revise, and verify. It frames the workflow as using the same model to generate an initial output, produce feedback on it, and iteratively improve, without additional training.
While self-refinement techniques have been around for a few years, we might be at a point where we can see them provide a step change in agentic applications. This was put on full display in the results of the ARC Prize, which dubbed 2025 as the “
Year of the Refinement Loop
” and wrote, “From an information theory perspective, refinement is intelligence.”
ARC tests models on complicated abstract reasoning puzzles. ARC’s own analysis reports that the top verified refinement solution, built on a frontier model and
developed by Poetiq
, reached 54% on ARC-AGI-2, beating the runner-up, Gemini 3 Deep Think (45%), at half the price.
Poetiq’s solution is a recursive, self-improving, system that is LLM-agnostic. It is designed to leverage the reasoning capabilities and knowledge of the underlying model to reflect and refine its own solution and invoke tools such as code interpreters when needed.
As models become stronger, adding self-refinement layers will make it possible to get more out of them. Poetiq is already working with partners to adapt its meta-system to “handle complex real-world problems that frontier models struggle to solve.”

We’re far from
streaming’s original promise
: instant access to beloved and undiscovered titles without the burden of ads, bundled services, or price gouging that have long been associated with cable.
Still, every year we get more dependent on streaming for entertainment. Despite streaming services’ flaws, many of us are bound to keep subscribing to at least one service next year. Here’s what we can expect in 2026 and beyond.
Subscription prices keep rising, but perhaps not as expected
There’s virtually no hope of streaming subscription prices plateauing in 2026. Streaming companies continue to face challenges as content production and licensing costs rise, and it’s often easier to get current customers to pay slightly more than to acquire new subscribers. Meanwhile, many streaming companies are still struggling with profitability and revenue after spending years focusing on winning subscribers with content.
“We see many services are only now aligning content spend with realistic lifetime value per subscriber,” Christofer Hamilton, industry insights manager at streaming analyst Parrot Analytics, told Ars.
Companies may get more creative with how they frame higher costs to subscribers, however. People who pay extra to stream without ads are the most likely to see price bumps as streaming companies continue pushing customers toward ad-based tiers.
Charging more for “premium” features—such as 4K streaming, simultaneous streams, or offline downloads—offers another way for streaming companies to boost revenue without implementing broad price hikes that
risk provoking customer outrage
. Subscribers can expect streaming prices to get “more menu-like next year,” said Michael Goodman, director of entertainment research at Parks Associates, a research firm focusing on IoT, consumer electronics, and entertainment.
When will the price hikes stop?
If streaming prices won’t stop rising next year, when will they?
Ultimately, it may be up to subscribers to vote with their dollars by canceling subscriptions or opting for
cheaper
or free alternatives, such as FAST (free ad-supported streaming television) channels with linear programming.
As Goodman put it, “Until we see net adds stall or decline as a result of price hikes, services have no incentive to stop raising prices.”
Some experts doubt that streaming services will ever willingly stop increasing prices. Bill Yousman, professor and director of the Media Literacy and Digital Culture graduate program at Sacred Heart University, sees precedent for this in
cable companies
.
“If the big streaming companies had their way, there would be no limit to their price hikes. We have already seen this with the cable monopolies and their disregard for consumer dissatisfaction,” he said.
Yousman believes that prices will only “be brought under control if there is some type of government regulation,” but he noted that’s unlikely under the Trump administration.
To date, US lawmakers haven’t shown interest in halting the steady rise of streaming prices. Most lawmakers who have sought to regulate the industry have focused on industry consolidation. There has been some effort from lawmakers to rein in streaming price hikes, though, especially through proposed federal legislation dubbed the
Price Gouging Prevention Act
.
Streaming services lean deeper into cable-like bundles
Companies will look to leverage subscribers’ frustration with pricing by being more aggressive about bundling third-party services like
traditional pay TV
, Internet, and cell phone service with streaming subscriptions. The idea is that people are less likely to cancel a streaming subscription if it’s tied to a different subscription (including another streaming subscription). The strategy echoes the days of cable, when some people kept unused landlines just to save money on cable channels or Internet service.
“For subscribers, 2026 is the year streaming stops feeling infinite and starts feeling more like premium cable used to: fewer apps, clearer bundles, and higher expectations for each service they pay for,” Parrot’s Hamilton said.
Thanks to traditional pay TV providers, bundles have a bad connotation among people looking to save money and simplify their subscriptions. But bundling doesn’t always have to be a bad thing, as Yousman explains:
If the companies wanted to really be responsive to consumers, they would let them design their own packages rather than having to choose options that may or may not include all the services they want. What works against this, of course, is the demand for ever-increasing profits at all times.
Should a sale of Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD’s) HBO Max be completed (late) next year, subscribers will face more pressure to bundle their streaming subscriptions.
“When dominant platforms like Netflix or Paramount absorb major content players, it accelerates the erosion of streaming’s original promise: freedom from monopolistic bundles,” Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of streaming technology provider Future Today, said.
Netflix and Paramount duke it out over Warner Bros.
WBD announced plans this month to sell
its streaming and movie studios business to Netflix
for an equity value of $72 billion, or an approximate total enterprise value of $82.7 billion. Paramount Skydance, however, quickly swooped in with a
hostile takeover bid for all of WBD
, including its cable channels, for $108.4 billion. A WBD shareholder vote will occur in spring or early summer, chairman Samuel Di Piazza
told CNBC
. By the end of 2026, we should have a clearer understanding of the future of HBO Max, as well as Netflix and Paramount+.
Any acquisition will be subject to regulatory scrutiny, causing more uncertainty for subscribers. If Netflix buys HBO Max, users of both services can expect higher prices due to reduced competition and the extensive amount of content and number of big-budget franchises (including Harry Potter and DC Comics) expected to unite under one platform.
“If Netflix gets [HBO Max] and the WB studios, HBO Max subscribers are more likely to see a smoother transition, strong ongoing investment in premium content, and simpler app/billing integration,” Parks Associates’ Goodman said.
But while the potential merger is worth watching, subscribers are unlikely to truly feel the impact of HBO Max potentially changing ownership until after 2026.
“Producing a show is a yearslong process, so the content that was already slated to air isn’t going to disappear, and the new content acquired through the WB library won’t be available until the merger is approved and closes,” Tre Lovell, attorney and owner of Los Angeles entertainment law firm The Lovell Firm, explained.
Content starts getting less bold
Looking beyond 2026, a sale of part or all of WBD would likely open the door for more streaming acquisitions. That could eventually benefit customers by making it easier to find content to watch with fewer subscriptions. But merged companies are also less likely to take risks on unique and diverse content.
Analysts I spoke with pointed to fewer niche and mid-tier original shows and movies and more show cancellations if either Netflix or Paramount buys HBO Max. Either buyer would probably focus more on the already-successful franchises that WB owns, such as
Game of Thrones
, Batman, and Superman.
“Big combined libraries push companies to double down on proven IP because it travels, merchandises, and reduces marketing risk,” said Robert Rosenberg, a partner at the New York law firm Moses Singer focusing on intellectual property, entertainment, technology, and data law.
Rosenberg also expects to see a “tilt toward” live events, sports, and unscripted content “for retention” if HBO Max sells.
In the shorter term, Rory Gooderick, research manager at analyst firm Ampere Analysis, predicted that WBD will be “cautious when greenlighting new large-scale projects until” the acquisition is finalized.
Beyond the potential HBO Max sale,
more merger activity
could lead to streaming services straying from their original selling point of
offering bolder, quirkier content
.
As the industry consolidates, “sticky content,” like procedurals, reality shows, and “comfort TV that drives long viewing sessions,” will take priority among mainstream, subscription-based streaming services, especially as they put more emphasis on ad-tier subscriptions, Goodman predicted.
A more stable future?
The new year will be formative for streaming and yield lasting impacts for subscribers. We’ve discussed numerous negative implications, but there could be a silver lining. While we may see more turbulence, hopefully, we’ll also start to see a road toward more stable streaming options.
Streaming subscribers can’t directly stop mergers or price hikes or control streaming libraries. But with services like Netflix and Disney+ focusing on becoming one-stop shops with massive libraries, there’s an opportunity for other services to hone their specialties and stand out by providing
offbeat, unexpected, and rare content
at more affordable prices.
As the landscape settles, streamers should be mindful of the importance of variety to subscribers. According to Bill Michels, chief product officer at Gracenote, Nielsen’s content data business unit:
There will be some consolidation. But the [connected TV] landscape, inclusive of FAST and [direct-to-consumer] channels, provides more than ample video variety for viewers, so the biggest challenge will be connecting content with the right audience. Audience engagement depends on good content. Audience retention depends on making sure audiences are never without something to watch.

So farewell, 2025 – you were frequently exciting, regularly chaotic, occasionally frustrating but always interesting. And that’s how we like it around here.
It was a year in which often fairly iterative improvements to hardware were overshadowed by rapid and significant advances on the computing side of things. I’m talking, of course, about AI, which is now so dominant within the tech world that it’s increasingly hard to find a device that doesn’t have an AI brain.
Not that I’m complaining, because the leaps made in 2025 by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora and
Google
’s Gemini were truly astonishing; the pace of change is such that it feels like we’re squeezing about a decade’s worth of advances into each year now, and I wouldn’t like to predict what the state of play will be in 12 months’ time. Well, other than to say that we’ll be taking for granted things which seem almost impossible right now – although as our AI Editor Graham Barlow notes below, maybe we’re already doing that.

In comparison, it often looked in 2025 as though things were slowing down on the hardware side. Could
Apple
really make its already-excellent MacBooks much better? Could
Samsung
improve much on the superb Galaxy S series? Was there much scope for
OLED
TVs or wireless headphones or mirrorless cameras to develop?
The answer was yes, yes and yes. Though the upgrades to many models may not have been as big as those on the software side, they were frequently excellent in their own right. The improvements to battery life, screen tech and camera lenses may not be as flashy as those on the AI front, but they can make a real difference to how we use our devices on a daily basis. In many ways, tech fans have never had it so good.
Whether that will continue in 2026 remains to be seen. AI now looks to be having a direct – and negative – effect on component prices, which could make your favorite new phone or laptop more expensive in the coming year. We might also see stock shortages in some areas, which could further inflate those price tags.
It looks like we’re set for another year of exciting, chaotic, frustrating and interesting news, then – and we’ll be here with you every step of the way. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading TechRadar in 2025, and have a happy New Year!

My year in tech
I bent reality, but I failed to bend an iPhone
2025 was the year AI image-creation became limited only by our imaginations

Lance Ulanoff

Editor at Large
This year was marked by astonishing leaps in AI capabilities, which I tried to not only report on but
experience in full
. From my first experience with
‘vibe coding’
to
wild leaps of fancy with Veo 3
(and later the Sora app) to
creating my own digital double
, AI’s fast-changing capabilities constantly amazed me.
Never in four decades of covering emerging technologies have I seen anything like it: AI’s rise continues to be a heady mixture of enthusiastic adoption tinged with white-knuckled fear about
what it all means for jobs
, and for humanity, and nothing we saw in 2025 did much to resolve that anxiety.
However, it was my conversations with those leading the AI and wider innovation charge that stood out. My interviews with
Amazon’s Panos Panay about Alexa+
and
Google’s Sameer Samat about the future of Android
were particularly memorable, as was the moment when one of Apple’s top executives threw his brand-new iPhone Air to me during a video podcast
and insisted that I try to bend it
.

The rise of
humanoid robots
was a trend that shocked and pleased me in equal measure, though I’ve tried to temper my enthusiasm with the knowledge that clever marketing and eye-popping videos will only get us so far. We all want the ultimate home robot, but I still don&#x27;t think many of us are willing to
pay $20,000 to get it
.
Away from all the AI and robots, I spent much of the year trying new phones, including redesigned iPhones and
an incredibly thin folding Samsung phone
, along with a wide range of wearable technology that included the
Galaxy XR headset
, and some very exciting
AR glasses from Meta
and
Google’s Android XR group
. Experiencing these felt like peering into our near technological future, which increasingly will be filled with on-demand AI, flexible phones, and maybe those robots.
The year in AI
This was the year we started taking AI for granted

Senior Editor, AI
For all the talk of breakthroughs and hype, 2025 felt less like the year AI changed everything and more like the year it quietly became unavoidable. While the much-hyped arrival of super-powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI), predicted for 2025 by many, simply hasn’t materialized, the year has still been a strong one for companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google. That said, there have also been some massive flops; and as for Apple, it feels like yet another year in which it slipped further behind in the AI race.
ChatGPT maintained its vice-like grip as the most popular AI
chatbot
in the world, though it hasn’t been plain sailing for OpenAI. Legal challenges, particularly the
copyright infringement claim
brought by The New York Times, have continued to dog the company, and in June its servers crashed for a couple of days, giving the world a brief taste of life without the ubiquitous chatbot.
OpenAI then fumbled the ball with the release of its
GPT
-5 model
, which came across as cold and unemotional compared to the previous GPT-4o. For millions of users who’d come to rely on the chatbot as something closer to a trusted companion it felt like a best friend had undergone a personality transplant overnight, forcing OpenAI to make the legacy 4o model available again.
The company has also lost a little ground to Google’s Gemini in recent months. The arrival of
Gemini 3 Pro
in November was well received, and on the image front, Gemini’s Nano Banana and
Nano Banana Pro
proved superior to ChatGPT for image generation. OpenAI responded with a
new image-generation model
in December.
AI-powered pets and toys also began to appear this year.
We took Moflin for a spin
, until we accidentally fried its battery. More broadly, the dominant theme of the year was that every product must now have AI built into it in some form, and no company exemplifies this approach better than
Microsoft
, which has spent the year enthusiastically
stuffing Copilot into just about everything it makes
.
Finally, the year looks set to end on a high note for
Amazon
.
Alexa+
, the AI-powered version of Alexa that Amazon has been promising all year but hasn’t yet managed to fully roll out, may finally be getting a web version, at least in the US.
THE YEAR IN PHONES
Slim pickings for thin phones, and hints of a tri-fold future

2025 was the year of the super-thin phone,
writes Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing
, with the release of the
Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge
in the first half of the year, and the
iPhone Air
in the second. These handsets grabbed headlines with their svelte proportions, but so far sales figures have yet to match the hype.
That’s likely due to their relatively high prices in the face of already pretty slim iPhones and Galaxy and Pixel handsets, all of which saw the expected yearly upgrades with the
iPhone 17
,
Galaxy S25
and
Pixel 10
lines respectively. While the upgrades to the iPhone 17 family appeared incremental at first glance, I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re a bigger deal when you dig into the details: there was a new design and cooling system for the Pro phones, the standard model finally got a 120Hz display, and Apple&#x27;s 48MP &#x27;Fusion&#x27; camera came to every iPhone in the lineup, including the Air (the Plus model went the way of the dodo).
AI found its way into more phones and more features, with
Google’s Pixel phones
in particular boasting a whole host of genuinely useful smart tools. Meanwhile, Apple just about managed to distract us from
the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence
with its flashy Liquid Glass design and the eye-catching Cosmic Orange
iPhone 17 Pro
.
Some of the most interesting phones came from smaller brands, with the
Nothing Phone 3
offering something a little different without scrimping on flagship features. There was the
Oppo Find X9 Pro
with its strange but useful camera kit, while the
OnePlus 15
was the only phone to earn a maximum five-star review from us this year. There were also a clutch of affordable phones from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi, proving that you don’t have to pay a lot to get a very capable smartphone these days.
We saw further evolution in the folding phone space, with the
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7
leading the way, and Samsung also unveiled its first tri-folding phone, with the
Galaxy Trifold
joining
Huawei&#x27;s Mate XT
, and teasing a future of devices that truly blend phones and tablets. We may even see a
foldable iPhone
in 2026, but don’t hold your breath.
THE YEAR IN COMPUTING
RAM drama enlivens a year of evolution over revolution
2025 saw Nvidia releasing its eagerly awaited RTX 5000 series of GPUs

Managing Editor, Core Tech
When it came to computing, 2025 didn&#x27;t start off as the most promising year. While 2024 felt like a year of revolutionary change, with the explosive growth of AI, the fall of
Intel
, and the rise of
Arm
-based laptops that were actually worth buying, this year has felt more like we&#x27;re in a holding pattern, as the innovations of the past few years are iterated on and refined.
The year kicked off with Nvidia launching its latest generation of consumer graphics cards,
the RTX 5000 series
, at CES 2025, and they encapsulated the ‘evolution, not revolution’ theme, with some great new features that haven&#x27;t fundamentally shaken up the industry, as the introduction of ray tracing with the RTX 2000 series did. Of course, making a great product even better is no bad thing, and our components editor and GPU expert John Loeffler was suitably impressed,
enthusing in his RTX 5090 review
that “If you&#x27;re a gamer, you&#x27;ll still get impressive gen-on-gen performance improvements over the celebrated RTX 4090, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 is really the first consumer graphics card I&#x27;ve tested that can get you consistent, high-frame-rate 8K gameplay.”
I have an RTX 5090 and I love it, and I&#x27;ve also been impressed by its
8K performance in modern games
, but with the majority of PC gamers still playing at 1080p, this high-end GPU might be a bit too expensive to justify. Other releases from AMD and
Intel
, plus
Apple’s latest M5 chip
, continued the theme of impressive releases that don’t massively change the computing landscape.
Perhaps the biggest event in 2025 was the continued rise of AI. Recently, the AI boom has led to a
global shortage of memory
, which has in turn caused an increase in the prices of devices that use it. All of a sudden, PCs, RAM, and GPUs look set to get increasingly expensive, though some, like our computing editor Christian Guyton,
aren’t too worried – yet
. Personally, the end-of-year drama is making me nostalgic for those early months when 2025 felt rather boring.
THE YEAR IN TVS
The era of giant, cheap TVs is here

Managing Editor, Entertainment
This year saw two really interesting developments in TV technology, with the first being the arrival of
a whole new kind of ‘Tandem RGB’ OLED TV panel from LG
. This appeared in the
LG G5
, helping it to score the maximum five stars in our review, and in the fantastic
Panasonic Z95B
, enabling both TVs to hit stunning levels of brightness and color depth, but with reduced power consumption.
However, this new screen technology didn’t win either of those sets our TV of the Year award – that went to the
Samsung S95F
, which not only earned its own perfect 5-star review, but was also voted the top TV in the most categories by the judges in our flagship OLED TV showdown, which pitted it against the LG G5,
Panasonic
Z95B, and
Sony Bravia 8 II
.
The second big tech development was the arrival of RGB mini-LED tech – and, make no mistake, this is the next big thing. It’s more efficient than current mini-LED tech, and is capable of richer colors and less light leakage from bright areas to dark ones, and it could be the tech to finally knock OLED off its perch.
We know that Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense
will all launch RGB mini-LED TV ranges in 2026
, but the
Hisense UX116
was the only TV to use it in 2025 – and it was a mixed bag, with performance issues that disappointed given its eye-wateringly high price. Still, we’re excited to see how this tech develops.
But the biggest thing in TVs this year was the TVs themselves – as in, they got big and they got affordable. TCL and Hisense launched 85-inch and 100-inch TVs that were within the budgets of regular mortals, and 75-inch TVs are becoming positively cheap, while still being good. While new tech is exciting, huge TVs like the
Hisense U8N
and
TCL QM7K
becoming more affordable is the change that made the biggest difference for customers.
THE YEAR IN VR/AR
Android XR arrives to challenge Meta’s dominance

This year XR or &#x27;extended reality&#x27; took center stage, thanks in large part to Android XR hardware finally breaking cover in the shape of the
Samsung Galaxy XR headset
. We also tested prototype
Android XR glasses
ahead of their expected release in the coming year, and they’re impressive (the glasses at least, the headset less so right now). Google, along with its Android partners, looks set to seriously challenge Meta in 2026.
For its part Meta debuted several new smart wearables over the past 12 months, including two pairs of Oakley smart glasses –
the stylish HSTNs
and the sporty Vanguards, the latter of which are
perfect for runners
when used with a compatible Garmin watch. We also saw a
Gen 2 model of the Meta Ray-Bans
, and the company&#x27;s latest step towards full-on AR specs, the
Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses
, which as you can probably guess feature a display for the specs to relay info visually. We’ve tested them, and they’re everything Google Glass wanted to be, but right now they&#x27;re not easy to get hold of.
What about VR headsets proper? Valve surprised no one (because the device was so heavily leaked before launch) with its
Steam Frame headset announcement
. Key details like the price are still a mystery, but it will be landing in 2026 – and when it does, the spec sheet teases a device that could
seriously challenge
the reigning champion of VR, the Meta Quest 3. Depending on how Valve handles the launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if it
makes all other headsets feel obsolete
– even the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro.
Talking of Apple&#x27;s mixed-reality spatial-computing headset, we got a
new version with an M5 chip
and comfier strap, but while it&#x27;s a worthwhile upgrade the price still feels too high.
THE YEAR IN AUDIO
The year the big dogs bit back

If 2024 was the year niche UK hi-fi brands took over the dance floor amid a hiatus from audio&#x27;s heavy hitters (see
Bowers &amp; Wilkins&#x27; fantastic Pi8 earbuds
or Cambridge Audio&#x27;s inaugural, affordable,
adorable P100 cans
), 2025 was the year the big dogs returned to the party and got their groove back.
We got five major headphones releases in 2025, starting with the
Beats Powerbeats Pro 2
earbuds in February. The hotly anticipated update to the 2019 Powerbeats Pro proved that Apple could indeed deliver heart-rate monitoring in its earbuds.
Cut to May and
Sony&#x27;s WH-1000XM6
landed, to
finally
knock the 2020-issue WH-1000XM4 off the top spot in our
best headphones guide
. It was a similar story with the June arrival of the
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)
, quickly followed by the
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen)
in September – a two-pronged attack on the market that saw Bose reinstated as the king of ANC.
However, this roundup wouldn&#x27;t be complete without a nod to the biggest launch of them all: the fall arrival of
Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro 3
. The shape&#x27;s different, the ANC is twice as good, and yes, like the Powerbeats Pro 2 they also keep tabs on your ticker, in a slightly different way, and with increasing third-party fitness-app support. Still the most popular earbuds in the world? Absolutely.
Elsewhere,
Spotify Lossless finally landed
, at no cost to Premium subscribers, offering almost-as-good-as-Apple-Music resolution at up to 24-bit/44.1kHz. While Lossless wasn&#x27;t a huge hit with fans initially, the big green streaming machine&#x27;s popularity continues to grow, despite concerns over artist payments.
Oh, and if you take note of just one audio brand name this year, let it be WiiM. As Sonos continues to tackle trust issues among its once-loyal fanbase, the plucky multi-room underdog unveiled its
WiiM Sound
(and now the WiiM Sound Lite) premium hi-res speakers – and the firm would love to help you build your wireless sound system around them.
THE YEAR IN CAMERAS
A memorable year for glass as well as for cameras

2025 was full of pleasant surprises for photographers. The
Sigma BF
was truly out of the ordinary, being dubbed ‘the camera Apple would have made’, while the
Caira
with its Nano Banana AI skills showed us a glimpse of how on-the-go generative editing can work in an actual camera.
Fujifilm and OM System showed us that user experience matters with the quirky
X half
and retro
OM-3
respectively, while Hasselblad and Nikon delivered strong offerings of their own – my favorite stills camera ever, the
X2D II
, and a new player in the cinema-camera game, the
Nikon Zr
. A special shoutout goes to Nikon for becoming the best-value camera brand this year, notably for the excellent
Z5 II
, which is our Camera of the Year, and
Z50 II
.
It was arguably an even better year for new lenses than cameras, with Sigma, Sony and Viltrox in particular knocking it out the park with world-first and affordable optics. Canon continues to lock out third parties from its full-frame camera lineup, but that decision feels more justified after it launched the affordable and capable
45mm F1.2 STM prime
.
A sense of order was restored towards the end of the year when Canon and Sony launched their anticipated mid-range full-frame cameras: the
EOS R6 III
and
A7 V
, both of which are integral to their lineups.
The long-threatened US ban on DJI products
finally came into effect
, and we saw a couple of major product launches from the brand in the build-up to it: the incredible (sort of)
sub-250g Mini 5 Pro
, and the
DJI Osmo 360
– its first foray into 360 cameras, and rival to both the
Insta 360 X5
and
GoPro’s new Max 2
. DJI is also being tipped to launch its first 360 drone soon, but Insta360 got there first with the truly innovative
Antigravity A1
.
Overall, it’s been a good year for camera fans, with demand seemingly remaining strong in the face of competition from increasingly capable smartphones. I’m predicting that the consumer and cinema camera spaces will continue converging in 2026, and I hope the likes of Viltrox expand our options with new and affordable autofocus zoom lenses.
The year in gaming

Rob Dwiar
Managing Editor, TechRadar Gaming
Gaming in 2025 was largely dominated by the arrival of the
Nintendo Switch 2
. It’s a safe improvement on the original Switch, and one that epitomizes the ‘evolution not revolution’ approach to console development.
The specs sheet won’t blow anyone’s socks off, but it’s a superb package that cements the Switch&#x27;s position as the go-to handheld console; and it was so popular in the pre-order and launch phases that it took months for retailers to catch up with demand. It’s been backed up by some excellent games too, including
Mario Kart World
,
Donkey Kong Bananza
,
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond
,
Kirby Air Riders
, and
Pokémon Legends Z-A
.
Sony had its own say in the gaming handheld space, breathing new life into the
PlayStation Portal
handheld device, which is now capable of excellent cloud streaming. This has elevated the handheld, which we were already big fans of, to impressive new heights.
The PS5’s game library got a bump with
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach
and
Ghost of Yotei
, as well as titles including
Borderlands 4
,
Battlefield 6
,
Arc Raiders
and
TechRadar Gaming’s Game of the Year
,
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
. Elsewhere, indie games ruled, with the likes of
Blue Prince
,
Hades 2
, and
Hollow Knight: Silksong
proving standouts in a strong year for releases.
It’s been a year to forget for Xbox, however, and its woes only accentuated the aforementioned successes for Nintendo and Sony. For starters, more Xbox games – including
Gears of War: Reloaded
– arrived on PS5, while others are set to follow, including the symbol of Xbox itself,
Halo
. Meanwhile studios were shuttered and prospective games cancelled, and to make matters worse the Xbox X/S were outsold by a tiny family console, the
Nex Playground
, over Black Friday. All in all it’s been tough going for Team Green.
As for 2026, it’s beginning to feel like the pace of progress towards next-gen consoles will quicken, and the game release calendar looks well stocked. However, a titan looms:
Grand Theft Auto 6
is now slated for release in November after being originally planned for late 2025, and the whole gaming world is going to revolve around its arrival.
THE YEAR IN FITNESS
Time’s finally up for wasteful wearables, thanks to Google
The Pixel Watch 4 is the first properly repairable smartwatch

Matt Evans

Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness &amp; Wearables
Last year, I ended my contribution to this round-up by predicting a move away from fitness watches towards screenless trackers, such as a new WHOOP model,
writes Matt Evans, Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness &amp; Wearables
. Well, we got not one, but two new WHOOPs, and they were… fine. But, as prices rose, I found the ongoing subscription model
far too expensive
.
However, my prediction that we’d move away from smartwatches hasn’t really been borne out. Wearable tech isn’t changing much in the mainstream, with the highest-profile releases being a slate of new watches from
Garmin
,
Apple
,
Samsung
, Google and
OnePlus
, and they’ve been as popular as ever.
Look beyond those big releases, however, and interesting new stuff is out there. A subscription-free WHOOP competitor band
was launched by Polar
, while Core Devices, the resurrected Pebble watch company led by its original founder, unveiled
a pair of watches
inspired by the original Pebble designs, complete with low-power LCD-style screens, and open-source software that anyone with the know-how can tinker with.
Core Devices also launched
a new kind of smart ring
with a button and a microphone, which the company says acts as “external memory for the brain”. Elsewhere, the
AirPods Pro 3 now have built-in heart rate sensors
, and Meta teamed up with Garmin to bring us the
Oakley Meta Vanguard sports specs
. Cool new wearable innovations are happening, but it all still feels quite fringe.
My innovation of the year, however, came from Google. The
Google Pixel Watch 4
is the first properly repairable smartwatch, as you’re able to take it apart and replace the battery and display. This enables you to change individual parts rather than the whole watch, reducing your contribution to e-waste, and saving you money in the long run.
Almost every other piece of wearable tech from every other company is still a sealed unit that will ultimately end up being disposed of, and I hope Google&#x27;s move could be the catalyst for change that the wasteful wearable tech industry sorely needs.
THE YEAR IN ENTERTAINMENT
Streaming sensations, box-office flops, and merger madness
The return of Stranger Things was one of 2025&#x27;s biggest streaming events
(Image credit: Netflix)
Tom Power

Senior Staff Writer
The biggest story of 2025 broke late in the year, and it concerned off-screen studio machinations rather than on-screen drama.
Netflix’s $82.7bn bid for Warner Bros.
sent shockwaves through the industry when it was announced in early December, and provoked a
counter-bid from Paramount Skydance
. There’s still a long way to go before a deal is approved, but should Netflix acquire one of the film world’s most iconic studios it would be a landmark moment for the streaming sector, and would represent a seismic shift for the entertainment industry as a whole.
Turning to the year&#x27;s big theatrical releases, and numerous new movies flopped at the box office, including some with huge names attached (I’m looking at you, Dwayne Johnson and
The Smashing Machine
). Heck, with
Captain America: Brave New World
,
Thunderbolts*
, and
The Fantastic Four: First Steps
all underperforming, even the usually reliable
Marvel Studios
didn’t have a money-spinning hit on its hands. I wonder how many people predicted that animated and live-action/CGI hybrids would rule the theatrical roost, led by multi-billion dollar-spinning flicks like
Lilo &amp; Stitch
,
Zootopia 2
, and
Ne Zha II
…
As for the major streaming services, users endured more of the now-customary annual price hikes, while Max raised eyebrows by
rebranding itself – again – to HBO Max
. On the screen, unexpected hits such as HBO medical drama
The Pitt
, plus Netflix&#x27;s ‘one-shot’ drama
Adolescence
and pop-culture phenomenon
Kpop Demon Hunters
, proved that not even the savviest industry exec can really be sure what viewers will latch onto. Add in the return of unmissable shows including
Severance
and
Stranger Things
amid the glut of great and not-so-great film and TV releases, and there was plenty to keep our eyeballs engaged. Now, what have you got in store for us, 2026?
The Year in Smart Home

Managing Editor, Lifestyle.
It&#x27;s been a slow but not insignificant year in home technology as legacy brands scramble to keep pace with bigger, already tech-savvy players vying for their spot in our homes – whether that&#x27;s
Breville reinventing the toaster
with a proprietary optical sensor,
IKEA launching new renewable energy solutions
, or Eufy and Dreame duking it out to give us the most effective
stair-climbing robot vacuum
.
Some brands were less innovative than others though. Dyson left some of us feeling snubbed with its &#x27;new&#x27;
(read: decade-old) vacuum
, while Shark&#x27;s TurboBlade Cool + Heat
failed to impress
despite its noble attempt at mimicking other SharkNinja product&#x27;s viral fame.
Elsewhere we saw big plays from Amazon and Google in the smart home space, with the arrival of their AI-bolstered home assistants.
Amazon&#x27;s Alexa+
and
Google&#x27;s Gemini for Home
both entered Early Access beta in the US, and while the early reviews for both have been mixed, it&#x27;s a promising glimpse into the future of the connected home.
Both of those services are subscription-based offerings, and subscriptions look set to become a major battleground for smart-home brands, and a bone of contention between brands and their customers, as companies attempt to lock users into their ecosystems, as we&#x27;ve already seen with video doorbells. Between that, and brands like
Samsung using screen-loaded appliances as advertising billboards
around the home, now might be a good time to really think about which brands you want want to invest in as you build your smart home.

So farewell, 2025 – you were frequently exciting, regularly chaotic, occasionally frustrating but always interesting. And that’s how we like it around here.
It was a year in which often fairly iterative improvements to hardware were overshadowed by rapid and significant advances on the computing side of things. I’m talking, of course, about AI, which is now so dominant within the tech world that it’s increasingly hard to find a device that doesn’t have an AI brain.
Not that I’m complaining, because the leaps made in 2025 by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora and
Google
’s Gemini were truly astonishing; the pace of change is such that it feels like we’re squeezing about a decade’s worth of advances into each year now, and I wouldn’t like to predict what the state of play will be in 12 months’ time. Well, other than to say that we’ll be taking for granted things which seem almost impossible right now – although as our AI Editor Graham Barlow notes below, maybe we’re already doing that.

In comparison, it often looked in 2025 as though things were slowing down on the hardware side. Could
Apple
really make its already-excellent MacBooks much better? Could
Samsung
improve much on the superb Galaxy S series? Was there much scope for
OLED
TVs or wireless headphones or mirrorless cameras to develop?
The answer was yes, yes and yes. Though the upgrades to many models may not have been as big as those on the software side, they were frequently excellent in their own right. The improvements to battery life, screen tech and camera lenses may not be as flashy as those on the AI front, but they can make a real difference to how we use our devices on a daily basis. In many ways, tech fans have never had it so good.
Whether that will continue in 2026 remains to be seen. AI now looks to be having a direct – and negative – effect on component prices, which could make your favorite new phone or laptop more expensive in the coming year. We might also see stock shortages in some areas, which could further inflate those price tags.
It looks like we’re set for another year of exciting, chaotic, frustrating and interesting news, then – and we’ll be here with you every step of the way. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading TechRadar in 2025, and have a happy New Year!

My year in tech
I bent reality, but I failed to bend an iPhone
2025 was the year AI image-creation became limited only by our imaginations
(Image credit: Future)
Lance Ulanoff

Editor at Large
This year was marked by astonishing leaps in AI capabilities, which I tried to not only report on but
experience in full
. From my first experience with
‘vibe coding’
to
wild leaps of fancy with Veo 3
(and later the Sora app) to
creating my own digital double
, AI’s fast-changing capabilities constantly amazed me.
Never in four decades of covering emerging technologies have I seen anything like it: AI’s rise continues to be a heady mixture of enthusiastic adoption tinged with white-knuckled fear about
what it all means for jobs
, and for humanity, and nothing we saw in 2025 did much to resolve that anxiety.
However, it was my conversations with those leading the AI and wider innovation charge that stood out. My interviews with
Amazon’s Panos Panay about Alexa+
and
Google’s Sameer Samat about the future of Android
were particularly memorable, as was the moment when one of Apple’s top executives threw his brand-new iPhone Air to me during a video podcast
and insisted that I try to bend it
.

The rise of
humanoid robots
was a trend that shocked and pleased me in equal measure, though I’ve tried to temper my enthusiasm with the knowledge that clever marketing and eye-popping videos will only get us so far. We all want the ultimate home robot, but I still don&#x27;t think many of us are willing to
pay $20,000 to get it
.
Away from all the AI and robots, I spent much of the year trying new phones, including redesigned iPhones and
an incredibly thin folding Samsung phone
, along with a wide range of wearable technology that included the
Galaxy XR headset
, and some very exciting
AR glasses from Meta
and
Google’s Android XR group
. Experiencing these felt like peering into our near technological future, which increasingly will be filled with on-demand AI, flexible phones, and maybe those robots.
The year in AI
This was the year we started taking AI for granted

Graham Barlow
Senior Editor, AI
For all the talk of breakthroughs and hype, 2025 felt less like the year AI changed everything and more like the year it quietly became unavoidable. While the much-hyped arrival of super-powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI), predicted for 2025 by many, simply hasn’t materialized, the year has still been a strong one for companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google. That said, there have also been some massive flops; and as for Apple, it feels like yet another year in which it slipped further behind in the AI race.
ChatGPT maintained its vice-like grip as the most popular AI
chatbot
in the world, though it hasn’t been plain sailing for OpenAI. Legal challenges, particularly the
copyright infringement claim
brought by The New York Times, have continued to dog the company, and in June its servers crashed for a couple of days, giving the world a brief taste of life without the ubiquitous chatbot.
OpenAI then fumbled the ball with the release of its
GPT
-5 model
, which came across as cold and unemotional compared to the previous GPT-4o. For millions of users who’d come to rely on the chatbot as something closer to a trusted companion it felt like a best friend had undergone a personality transplant overnight, forcing OpenAI to make the legacy 4o model available again.
The company has also lost a little ground to Google’s Gemini in recent months. The arrival of
Gemini 3 Pro
in November was well received, and on the image front, Gemini’s Nano Banana and
Nano Banana Pro
proved superior to ChatGPT for image generation. OpenAI responded with a
new image-generation model
in December.
AI-powered pets and toys also began to appear this year.
We took Moflin for a spin
, until we accidentally fried its battery. More broadly, the dominant theme of the year was that every product must now have AI built into it in some form, and no company exemplifies this approach better than
Microsoft
, which has spent the year enthusiastically
stuffing Copilot into just about everything it makes
.
Finally, the year looks set to end on a high note for
Amazon
.
Alexa+
, the AI-powered version of Alexa that Amazon has been promising all year but hasn’t yet managed to fully roll out, may finally be getting a web version, at least in the US.
THE YEAR IN PHONES
Slim pickings for thin phones, and hints of a tri-fold future
2025 saw Samsung unveiling its first tri-folding phone

Managing Editor, News
2025 was the year of the super-thin phone,
writes Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing
, with the release of the
Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge
in the first half of the year, and the
iPhone Air
in the second. These handsets grabbed headlines with their svelte proportions, but so far sales figures have yet to match the hype.
That’s likely due to their relatively high prices in the face of already pretty slim iPhones and Galaxy and Pixel handsets, all of which saw the expected yearly upgrades with the
iPhone 17
,
Galaxy S25
and
Pixel 10
lines respectively. While the upgrades to the iPhone 17 family appeared incremental at first glance, I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re a bigger deal when you dig into the details: there was a new design and cooling system for the Pro phones, the standard model finally got a 120Hz display, and Apple&#x27;s 48MP &#x27;Fusion&#x27; camera came to every iPhone in the lineup, including the Air (the Plus model went the way of the dodo).
AI found its way into more phones and more features, with
Google’s Pixel phones
in particular boasting a whole host of genuinely useful smart tools. Meanwhile, Apple just about managed to distract us from
the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence
with its flashy Liquid Glass design and the eye-catching Cosmic Orange
iPhone 17 Pro
.
Some of the most interesting phones came from smaller brands, with the
Nothing Phone 3
offering something a little different without scrimping on flagship features. There was the
Oppo Find X9 Pro
with its strange but useful camera kit, while the
OnePlus 15
was the only phone to earn a maximum five-star review from us this year. There were also a clutch of affordable phones from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi, proving that you don’t have to pay a lot to get a very capable smartphone these days.
We saw further evolution in the folding phone space, with the
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7
leading the way, and Samsung also unveiled its first tri-folding phone, with the
Galaxy Trifold
joining
Huawei&#x27;s Mate XT
, and teasing a future of devices that truly blend phones and tablets. We may even see a
foldable iPhone
in 2026, but don’t hold your breath.
THE YEAR IN COMPUTING
RAM drama enlivens a year of evolution over revolution
2025 saw Nvidia releasing its eagerly awaited RTX 5000 series of GPUs

Managing Editor, Core Tech
When it came to computing, 2025 didn&#x27;t start off as the most promising year. While 2024 felt like a year of revolutionary change, with the explosive growth of AI, the fall of
Intel
, and the rise of
Arm
-based laptops that were actually worth buying, this year has felt more like we&#x27;re in a holding pattern, as the innovations of the past few years are iterated on and refined.
The year kicked off with Nvidia launching its latest generation of consumer graphics cards,
the RTX 5000 series
, at CES 2025, and they encapsulated the ‘evolution, not revolution’ theme, with some great new features that haven&#x27;t fundamentally shaken up the industry, as the introduction of ray tracing with the RTX 2000 series did. Of course, making a great product even better is no bad thing, and our components editor and GPU expert John Loeffler was suitably impressed,
enthusing in his RTX 5090 review
that “If you&#x27;re a gamer, you&#x27;ll still get impressive gen-on-gen performance improvements over the celebrated RTX 4090, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 is really the first consumer graphics card I&#x27;ve tested that can get you consistent, high-frame-rate 8K gameplay.”
I have an RTX 5090 and I love it, and I&#x27;ve also been impressed by its
8K performance in modern games
, but with the majority of PC gamers still playing at 1080p, this high-end GPU might be a bit too expensive to justify. Other releases from AMD and
Intel
, plus
Apple’s latest M5 chip
, continued the theme of impressive releases that don’t massively change the computing landscape.
Perhaps the biggest event in 2025 was the continued rise of AI. Recently, the AI boom has led to a
global shortage of memory
, which has in turn caused an increase in the prices of devices that use it. All of a sudden, PCs, RAM, and GPUs look set to get increasingly expensive, though some, like our computing editor Christian Guyton,
aren’t too worried – yet
. Personally, the end-of-year drama is making me nostalgic for those early months when 2025 felt rather boring.
THE YEAR IN TVS
The era of giant, cheap TVs is here

Managing Editor, Entertainment
This year saw two really interesting developments in TV technology, with the first being the arrival of
a whole new kind of ‘Tandem RGB’ OLED TV panel from LG
. This appeared in the
LG G5
, helping it to score the maximum five stars in our review, and in the fantastic
Panasonic Z95B
, enabling both TVs to hit stunning levels of brightness and color depth, but with reduced power consumption.
However, this new screen technology didn’t win either of those sets our TV of the Year award – that went to the
Samsung S95F
, which not only earned its own perfect 5-star review, but was also voted the top TV in the most categories by the judges in our flagship OLED TV showdown, which pitted it against the LG G5,
Panasonic
Z95B, and
Sony Bravia 8 II
.
The second big tech development was the arrival of RGB mini-LED tech – and, make no mistake, this is the next big thing. It’s more efficient than current mini-LED tech, and is capable of richer colors and less light leakage from bright areas to dark ones, and it could be the tech to finally knock OLED off its perch.
We know that Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense
will all launch RGB mini-LED TV ranges in 2026
, but the
Hisense UX116
was the only TV to use it in 2025 – and it was a mixed bag, with performance issues that disappointed given its eye-wateringly high price. Still, we’re excited to see how this tech develops.
But the biggest thing in TVs this year was the TVs themselves – as in, they got big and they got affordable. TCL and Hisense launched 85-inch and 100-inch TVs that were within the budgets of regular mortals, and 75-inch TVs are becoming positively cheap, while still being good. While new tech is exciting, huge TVs like the
Hisense U8N
and
TCL QM7K
becoming more affordable is the change that made the biggest difference for customers.
THE YEAR IN VR/AR
Android XR arrives to challenge Meta’s dominance

This year XR or &#x27;extended reality&#x27; took center stage, thanks in large part to Android XR hardware finally breaking cover in the shape of the
Samsung Galaxy XR headset
. We also tested prototype
Android XR glasses
ahead of their expected release in the coming year, and they’re impressive (the glasses at least, the headset less so right now). Google, along with its Android partners, looks set to seriously challenge Meta in 2026.
For its part Meta debuted several new smart wearables over the past 12 months, including two pairs of Oakley smart glasses –
the stylish HSTNs
and the sporty Vanguards, the latter of which are
perfect for runners
when used with a compatible Garmin watch. We also saw a
Gen 2 model of the Meta Ray-Bans
, and the company&#x27;s latest step towards full-on AR specs, the
Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses
, which as you can probably guess feature a display for the specs to relay info visually. We’ve tested them, and they’re everything Google Glass wanted to be, but right now they&#x27;re not easy to get hold of.
What about VR headsets proper? Valve surprised no one (because the device was so heavily leaked before launch) with its
Steam Frame headset announcement
. Key details like the price are still a mystery, but it will be landing in 2026 – and when it does, the spec sheet teases a device that could
seriously challenge
the reigning champion of VR, the Meta Quest 3. Depending on how Valve handles the launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if it
makes all other headsets feel obsolete
– even the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro.
Talking of Apple&#x27;s mixed-reality spatial-computing headset, we got a
new version with an M5 chip
and comfier strap, but while it&#x27;s a worthwhile upgrade the price still feels too high.
THE YEAR IN AUDIO
The year the big dogs bit back

If 2024 was the year niche UK hi-fi brands took over the dance floor amid a hiatus from audio&#x27;s heavy hitters (see
Bowers &amp; Wilkins&#x27; fantastic Pi8 earbuds
or Cambridge Audio&#x27;s inaugural, affordable,
adorable P100 cans
), 2025 was the year the big dogs returned to the party and got their groove back.
We got five major headphones releases in 2025, starting with the
Beats Powerbeats Pro 2
earbuds in February. The hotly anticipated update to the 2019 Powerbeats Pro proved that Apple could indeed deliver heart-rate monitoring in its earbuds.
Cut to May and
Sony&#x27;s WH-1000XM6
landed, to
finally
knock the 2020-issue WH-1000XM4 off the top spot in our
best headphones guide
. It was a similar story with the June arrival of the
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)
, quickly followed by the
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen)
in September – a two-pronged attack on the market that saw Bose reinstated as the king of ANC.
However, this roundup wouldn&#x27;t be complete without a nod to the biggest launch of them all: the fall arrival of
Apple&#x27;s AirPods Pro 3
. The shape&#x27;s different, the ANC is twice as good, and yes, like the Powerbeats Pro 2 they also keep tabs on your ticker, in a slightly different way, and with increasing third-party fitness-app support. Still the most popular earbuds in the world? Absolutely.
Elsewhere,
Spotify Lossless finally landed
, at no cost to Premium subscribers, offering almost-as-good-as-Apple-Music resolution at up to 24-bit/44.1kHz. While Lossless wasn&#x27;t a huge hit with fans initially, the big green streaming machine&#x27;s popularity continues to grow, despite concerns over artist payments.
Oh, and if you take note of just one audio brand name this year, let it be WiiM. As Sonos continues to tackle trust issues among its once-loyal fanbase, the plucky multi-room underdog unveiled its
WiiM Sound
(and now the WiiM Sound Lite) premium hi-res speakers – and the firm would love to help you build your wireless sound system around them.
THE YEAR IN CAMERAS
A memorable year for glass as well as for cameras
If Apple made cameras: the Sigma BF was one of 2025&#x27;s standout launches

Cameras Editor
2025 was full of pleasant surprises for photographers. The
Sigma BF
was truly out of the ordinary, being dubbed ‘the camera Apple would have made’, while the
Caira
with its Nano Banana AI skills showed us a glimpse of how on-the-go generative editing can work in an actual camera.
Fujifilm and OM System showed us that user experience matters with the quirky
X half
and retro
OM-3
respectively, while Hasselblad and Nikon delivered strong offerings of their own – my favorite stills camera ever, the
X2D II
, and a new player in the cinema-camera game, the
Nikon Zr
. A special shoutout goes to Nikon for becoming the best-value camera brand this year, notably for the excellent
Z5 II
, which is our Camera of the Year, and
Z50 II
.
It was arguably an even better year for new lenses than cameras, with Sigma, Sony and Viltrox in particular knocking it out the park with world-first and affordable optics. Canon continues to lock out third parties from its full-frame camera lineup, but that decision feels more justified after it launched the affordable and capable
45mm F1.2 STM prime
.
A sense of order was restored towards the end of the year when Canon and Sony launched their anticipated mid-range full-frame cameras: the
EOS R6 III
and
A7 V
, both of which are integral to their lineups.
The long-threatened US ban on DJI products
finally came into effect
, and we saw a couple of major product launches from the brand in the build-up to it: the incredible (sort of)
sub-250g Mini 5 Pro
, and the
DJI Osmo 360
– its first foray into 360 cameras, and rival to both the
Insta 360 X5
and
GoPro’s new Max 2
. DJI is also being tipped to launch its first 360 drone soon, but Insta360 got there first with the truly innovative
Antigravity A1
.
Overall, it’s been a good year for camera fans, with demand seemingly remaining strong in the face of competition from increasingly capable smartphones. I’m predicting that the consumer and cinema camera spaces will continue converging in 2026, and I hope the likes of Viltrox expand our options with new and affordable autofocus zoom lenses.
The year in gaming

Rob Dwiar
Managing Editor, TechRadar Gaming
Gaming in 2025 was largely dominated by the arrival of the
Nintendo Switch 2
. It’s a safe improvement on the original Switch, and one that epitomizes the ‘evolution not revolution’ approach to console development.
The specs sheet won’t blow anyone’s socks off, but it’s a superb package that cements the Switch&#x27;s position as the go-to handheld console; and it was so popular in the pre-order and launch phases that it took months for retailers to catch up with demand. It’s been backed up by some excellent games too, including
Mario Kart World
,
Donkey Kong Bananza
,
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond
,
Kirby Air Riders
, and
Pokémon Legends Z-A
.
Sony had its own say in the gaming handheld space, breathing new life into the
PlayStation Portal
handheld device, which is now capable of excellent cloud streaming. This has elevated the handheld, which we were already big fans of, to impressive new heights.
The PS5’s game library got a bump with
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach
and
Ghost of Yotei
, as well as titles including
Borderlands 4
,
Battlefield 6
,
Arc Raiders
and
TechRadar Gaming’s Game of the Year
,
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
. Elsewhere, indie games ruled, with the likes of
Blue Prince
,
Hades 2
, and
Hollow Knight: Silksong
proving standouts in a strong year for releases.
It’s been a year to forget for Xbox, however, and its woes only accentuated the aforementioned successes for Nintendo and Sony. For starters, more Xbox games – including
Gears of War: Reloaded
– arrived on PS5, while others are set to follow, including the symbol of Xbox itself,
Halo
. Meanwhile studios were shuttered and prospective games cancelled, and to make matters worse the Xbox X/S were outsold by a tiny family console, the
Nex Playground
, over Black Friday. All in all it’s been tough going for Team Green.
As for 2026, it’s beginning to feel like the pace of progress towards next-gen consoles will quicken, and the game release calendar looks well stocked. However, a titan looms:
Grand Theft Auto 6
is now slated for release in November after being originally planned for late 2025, and the whole gaming world is going to revolve around its arrival.
THE YEAR IN FITNESS
Time’s finally up for wasteful wearables, thanks to Google
The Pixel Watch 4 is the first properly repairable smartwatch

Matt Evans

Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness &amp; Wearables
Last year, I ended my contribution to this round-up by predicting a move away from fitness watches towards screenless trackers, such as a new WHOOP model,
writes Matt Evans, Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness &amp; Wearables
. Well, we got not one, but two new WHOOPs, and they were… fine. But, as prices rose, I found the ongoing subscription model
far too expensive
.
However, my prediction that we’d move away from smartwatches hasn’t really been borne out. Wearable tech isn’t changing much in the mainstream, with the highest-profile releases being a slate of new watches from
Garmin
,
Apple
,
Samsung
, Google and
OnePlus
, and they’ve been as popular as ever.
Look beyond those big releases, however, and interesting new stuff is out there. A subscription-free WHOOP competitor band
was launched by Polar
, while Core Devices, the resurrected Pebble watch company led by its original founder, unveiled
a pair of watches
inspired by the original Pebble designs, complete with low-power LCD-style screens, and open-source software that anyone with the know-how can tinker with.
Core Devices also launched
a new kind of smart ring
with a button and a microphone, which the company says acts as “external memory for the brain”. Elsewhere, the
AirPods Pro 3 now have built-in heart rate sensors
, and Meta teamed up with Garmin to bring us the
Oakley Meta Vanguard sports specs
. Cool new wearable innovations are happening, but it all still feels quite fringe.
My innovation of the year, however, came from Google. The
Google Pixel Watch 4
is the first properly repairable smartwatch, as you’re able to take it apart and replace the battery and display. This enables you to change individual parts rather than the whole watch, reducing your contribution to e-waste, and saving you money in the long run.
Almost every other piece of wearable tech from every other company is still a sealed unit that will ultimately end up being disposed of, and I hope Google&#x27;s move could be the catalyst for change that the wasteful wearable tech industry sorely needs.
THE YEAR IN ENTERTAINMENT
Streaming sensations, box-office flops, and merger madness
The return of Stranger Things was one of 2025&#x27;s biggest streaming events

Tom Power

Senior Staff Writer
The biggest story of 2025 broke late in the year, and it concerned off-screen studio machinations rather than on-screen drama.
Netflix’s $82.7bn bid for Warner Bros.
sent shockwaves through the industry when it was announced in early December, and provoked a
counter-bid from Paramount Skydance
. There’s still a long way to go before a deal is approved, but should Netflix acquire one of the film world’s most iconic studios it would be a landmark moment for the streaming sector, and would represent a seismic shift for the entertainment industry as a whole.
Turning to the year&#x27;s big theatrical releases, and numerous new movies flopped at the box office, including some with huge names attached (I’m looking at you, Dwayne Johnson and
The Smashing Machine
). Heck, with
Captain America: Brave New World
,
Thunderbolts*
, and
The Fantastic Four: First Steps
all underperforming, even the usually reliable
Marvel Studios
didn’t have a money-spinning hit on its hands. I wonder how many people predicted that animated and live-action/CGI hybrids would rule the theatrical roost, led by multi-billion dollar-spinning flicks like
Lilo &amp; Stitch
,
Zootopia 2
, and
Ne Zha II
…
As for the major streaming services, users endured more of the now-customary annual price hikes, while Max raised eyebrows by
rebranding itself – again – to HBO Max
. On the screen, unexpected hits such as HBO medical drama
The Pitt
, plus Netflix&#x27;s ‘one-shot’ drama
Adolescence
and pop-culture phenomenon
Kpop Demon Hunters
, proved that not even the savviest industry exec can really be sure what viewers will latch onto. Add in the return of unmissable shows including
Severance
and
Stranger Things
amid the glut of great and not-so-great film and TV releases, and there was plenty to keep our eyeballs engaged. Now, what have you got in store for us, 2026?
The Year in Smart Home

Josephine Watson
Managing Editor, Lifestyle.
It&#x27;s been a slow but not insignificant year in home technology as legacy brands scramble to keep pace with bigger, already tech-savvy players vying for their spot in our homes – whether that&#x27;s
Breville reinventing the toaster
with a proprietary optical sensor,
IKEA launching new renewable energy solutions
, or Eufy and Dreame duking it out to give us the most effective
stair-climbing robot vacuum
.
Some brands were less innovative than others though. Dyson left some of us feeling snubbed with its &#x27;new&#x27;
(read: decade-old) vacuum
, while Shark&#x27;s TurboBlade Cool + Heat
failed to impress
despite its noble attempt at mimicking other SharkNinja product&#x27;s viral fame.
Elsewhere we saw big plays from Amazon and Google in the smart home space, with the arrival of their AI-bolstered home assistants.
Amazon&#x27;s Alexa+
and
Google&#x27;s Gemini for Home
both entered Early Access beta in the US, and while the early reviews for both have been mixed, it&#x27;s a promising glimpse into the future of the connected home.
Both of those services are subscription-based offerings, and subscriptions look set to become a major battleground for smart-home brands, and a bone of contention between brands and their customers, as companies attempt to lock users into their ecosystems, as we&#x27;ve already seen with video doorbells. Between that, and brands like
Samsung using screen-loaded appliances as advertising billboards
around the home, now might be a good time to really think about which brands you want want to invest in as you build your smart home.

LG is adding a karaoke-focused party speaker to its lineup of Xboom devices, which is built in collaboration with Will.i.am. Announced this week, LG says
the Stage 501 speaker
comes with an “AI Karaoke Master” that can remove or adjust vocals from “virtually any song,” similar to the
Soundcore Rave 3S
.
It can also adjust the pitch of the songs to make them more comfortable to sing, and it doesn’t require karaoke-specific audio files to do so, according to LG. Like
its predecessor
, the Stage 501 features a five-sided design but comes equipped with upgraded dual woofers and full-range drivers that LG claims will deliver richer audio. The swappable 99Wh battery offers up to 25 hours of playback and delivers 160W of power (or up to 220W when plugged in).

There’s the Xboom Blast, too, which is a little smaller than the Stage 501 and is built for outdoor use, featuring edge bumpers and two handles for easy carrying. This speaker also comes with a 99Wh battery for up to 35 hours of playback.
LG has added a couple of compact speakers to its lineup as well: the Xboom Mini and Xboom Rock. With the Mini, you can expect up to 10 hours of playback and IP67 water and dust resistance, while the Rock promises the same battery life with
support for Bluetooth Auracast
, a feature that allows you to broadcast audio across multiple speakers at once.

All four speakers have an AI-powered feature that analyzes audio and “adjusts EQ settings to bring out melody, rhythm or vocals,” according to LG. The company also says the speakers use AI to adjust built-in lighting based on the song, while the Stage 501 and Blast use a technology called “Space Calibration Pro” to adjust sound quality based on the surrounding environment.
LG hasn’t yet revealed the pricing for these new speakers, but the company says it will launch the new devices this year.

How to watch Hyundai&#x27;s CES 2026 presentation live
The motor company is set to show off its new Holographic Windshield Display.

A look at Hyundai&#x27;s Holographic Windshield Display. (Hyundai)
While it often feels like a full-on auto show, the car vibes feel somewhat lessened at
CES 2026
. Yes, the
Afeela electric vehicle
from the
Sony-Honda joint venture
will be back on the floor, but with the Trump administration
yanking most EV incentives
from the market, the industry isn&#x27;t offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there&#x27;s still plenty of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai&#x27;s
Holographic Windshield Display
.
Indeed, the company&#x27;s
Mobis subsidiary
will present &quot;more than 30 mobility convergence technologies&quot; during CES. And we&#x27;ll also get to see Hyundai&#x27;s
AI Robotics Strategy
, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab.
How to watch Hyundai&#x27;s presentation at CES 2026
Hyundai&#x27;s presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its
HyundaiUSA YouTube channel
or its
global YouTube channel
. We&#x27;ll embed the stream here once it&#x27;s available.
What to expect
As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It&#x27;s essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle&#x27;s dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver&#x27;s view. It&#x27;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.

Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &quot;world&#x27;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&quot; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#x27;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.
Beyond automotive, though, we&#x27;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#x27;s new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was
purchased by the Korean multinational
back in 2020.
&quot;This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,&quot; the company said in the same press release.
Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.
