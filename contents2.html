                <div class="summary">Nuclear startup
Deep Fission
announced Monday that it has gone public in a reverse merger, netting the company $30 million. No, it’s not 2021. The startup is proposing to build small, cylindrical nuclear power plants and
lower them into 30-inch diameter holes
drilled one mile down into the Earth. By burying the reactors, the company hopes to solve several problems that plague current reactors, including concerns over meltdowns and potential terrorist attacks. Deep Fission’s 15-megawatt reactors are cooled using pressurized water, the same type found in nuclear submarines and many existing power plants. Earlier this year, Deep Fission inked a deal with data center developer Endeavor to build 2 gigawatts of underground reactors. As recently as April, the startup had been
attempting to raise
a $15 million seed round. In August, Deep Fission and nine other nuclear fission startups were selected to be a part of the Department of Energy’s
Reactor Pilot Program
, essentially a streamlined permitting process. Under the terms of the reverse merger with four-year-old Surfside Acquisition Inc., the offering was priced at $3 per share, below the customary $10 that other SPACs target. The new entity will retain the Deep Fission name, and though its shares aren’t yet trading, it says it intends to quote on the OTCQB. Techcrunch event

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday authorizing the Department of Defense to refer to itself as the Department of War, reverting to a more bellicose title used until a 1940s-era military shakeup in the aftermath of World War II. The order approves the Pentagon&#x27;s use of the Department of War name as an &quot;additional secondary title&quot; for the Department of Defense while the Trump administration seeks congressional approval to officially change the name. Until Congress votes on the issue, the name change is effectively a rebrand of the DoD that could be reversed with the signature of a future president. But there was another potential name change revealed by the Pentagon on Friday, just hours before Trump signed the War Department order. This one may have more staying power. The news first appeared in a standard announcement of promotions and new assignments for 17 general and flag officers. One of the reassignments was for Maj. Gen.</div>

Some of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.</div>

Google is opening up
AI Mode
to more languages. Starting today, the AI chatbot the company is integrating into Google Search is available in Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean and Brazilian Portuguese. The company has been rapidly expanding access to the search experience. In May, Google started offering it to
everyone in the US
(and later the UK and India) after starting public tests just two months earlier. Google
added more features
to AI Mode in July, including support for the Gemini 2.5 Pro model and Deep Search. As of last month, AI Mode has been present in
more than 180 countries
. But until now, AI Mode had only been available in English. This is the
first language support expansion
for the chatbot. Advertisement

&quot;Building a truly global Search goes far beyond translation — it requires a nuanced understanding of local information,&quot; Hema Budaraju, Google&#x27;s vice president of search product management
wrote in a blog post
. &quot;With the advanced multimodal and reasoning capabilities of our custom version of Gemini 2.5 in Search, we’ve made huge strides in language understanding, so our most advanced AI search capabilities are locally relevant and useful in each new language we support.&quot;
Google has been
claiming
recently that traffic to websites from Search is &quot;relatively stable&quot; since the rollout of AI Overviews and that
&quot;the web is thriving.&quot;
However, the company admitted something very different in a court filing last week. Its lawyers
stated
that &quot;the open web is already in rapid decline.&quot; That, plus the expansion of AI Mode, will surely be welcomed with open arms by publishers who are
seriously feeling the pinch of declining web traffic

                <div class="summary">Hyundai’s electric air taxi startup Supernal has paused work on its aircraft program after a rocky few months that saw staff cuts and the departure of its CEO and CTO, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The shakeup comes at a time when Supernal has barely gotten off the ground — literally. The first test flight of its technology demonstrator
happened earlier this year
. And though Supernal has performed subsequent tests, the company was still working toward its first untethered test flight before the pause. The company had planned to launch a commercial service in 2028. Supernal announced the departure of CEO Jaiwon Shin late last week. David McBride, the CTO, has also left, according to people familiar, who were granted anonymity to speak about private company matters. The OC Register
first reported
the pause on Supernal’s flight program and McBride’s departure. With regards to the commercial service, the startup told TechCrunch that the “newly appointed leadership will assess and determine the optimal timeline moving forward.” The company declined to comment on McBride leaving. Supernal’s struggles come as the nascent electric air taxi industry is in a period of upheaval. Some startups, like Toyota-backed Joby, have been
raising and announcing partnerships and acquisitions
. Others, like Lillium, have
gone out of business
. Spun out of the Hyundai Group in 2021, Supernal
laid off dozens
earlier this summer ahead of the executive shakeup. That followed the startup abruptly winding down its still-new Washington, D.C. headquarters late last year, as
TechCrunch previously reported

Today, Porsche debuted a new 911 variant at the IAA Mobility show in Munich, Germany. It&#x27;s the most powerful 911 to date, excluding some limited-run models, and may well be the quickest to 60 mph from a standing start, dispatching that dash in just 2.4 seconds. And it&#x27;s all thanks to one of the most interesting hybrid powertrains on sale today. Rather than just bolting an electric motor to an existing 911, Porsche designed an entirely new 3.6 L flat-six engine, taking the opportunity to ditch the belt drive and move some of the ancillaries, which can instead be powered by the car&#x27;s 400 V traction battery. The system debuted in the 911 GTS T-Hybrid,
which Ars recently reviewed
. For that car, Porsche added a single electric turbocharger, which works like the MGU-H in a Formula 1 car. It spins up almost instantly to 120,000 rpm to eliminate throttle lag, but also recaptures excess energy from the spinning turbine and sends that to the 1.9 kWh battery pack. The result is a turbocharged engine that has a remarkable throttle response that&#x27;s more like an EV, with no perceptible lag between initial tip-in and power being delivered to the wheels. For the 2026 911 Turbo S, there are a pair of these electric turbochargers.</div>

XCY X108 can theoretically handle 204TB inside a shoebox-sized case
Intel’s N150 processor delivers modest performance with low power draw
Eight SATA bays allow configurations scaling far beyond 144TB storage
The XCY X108 is an unusually compact network-attached storage system designed to provide very high capacity in a small enclosure. It supports up to eight 3.5-inch bays, which at 18TB each provide 144TB of capacity, or considerably more with newer 30TB and 36TB drives. When combined with additional M.2 slots, the total theoretical capacity reaches 204TB, putting it close to the
largest HDD
arrays available in devices of this size. You may like
Kiwi storage startup uses proprietary 144TB SSD to hit 230PB storage per 42U rack - but it will cost well over $2 million to get such a system
This tiny NAS can store up to 32TB of super-fast SSD data and even comes with a VPN server and a 4K HDMI port
A workstation PC with 540TB storage is within reach — this tower case can hold up to 15 x 36TB Seagate HDDs
Design and internal specifications
Slightly larger than two stacked shoeboxes, the XCY X108 remains modest in size while offering several storage options. Buyers can choose between versions with four, six, or eight bays, depending on capacity requirements. The system runs on
Intel
’s N150, a 10nm processor with four cores and four threads clocked up to 3.6GHz. Although not that powerful compared with
workstation
hardware, its lower energy draw may prove useful for a device intended for continuous operation. Are you a pro?</div>

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget. General Motors is going to be
scaling back production
of the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq, as well as the Chevy Bolt EV as it expects sales of electric vehicles to slow dramatically. The $7,500
consumer tax credit
for purchasing a new EV is set to expire at the end of the month. That credit has been crucial to driving demand for EVs, which are still more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts. The company is pausing production on the Lyriq and Vistiq at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant in December. It’s also planning to halt manufacturing for a week in November and October, as well as slow production during the first five months of 2026 by temporarily laying off one of its shifts of workers.</div>

Microsoft&#x27;s cloud service restored after reports of cut cables in the Red Sea
An incident involving &quot;undersea fiber cuts&quot; that affected the Middle East was resolved by Saturday evening. Jackson Chen

Microsoft said its
Azure cloud platform
has returned to normal service after an incident of cut underwater cables that played out over Saturday. The tech giant reported &quot;
undersea fiber cuts
&quot; in the Red Sea on Saturday morning, which disrupted Azure service throughout the Middle East and led to potential &quot;increased latency&quot; for users. Microsoft said that the latency issue was resolved by Saturday evening and was able to reroute the Azure traffic through other paths. Microsoft didn&#x27;t provide a reason for why the undersea cables were cut. These cables sit on the ocean floor and play the crucial role of delivering massive amounts of data across the world. While ships dropping anchors can sometimes damage undersea cables, there have been more intentional circumstances in the past. In 2024, the internationally recognized government of Yemen claimed that the country&#x27;s Houthi movement was responsible for
cutting cables
in the Red Sea. While Microsoft managed to restore service for its latest episode the same day, it also noted that undersea cable cuts &quot;can take time to repair&quot; and that it &quot;will continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimize routing to reduce customer impact in the meantime.&quot;
