                <div class="summary">YouTube has won exclusive rights to stream the Oscars starting in 2029, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
announced
on Wednesday. The Google-owned platform outbid other contenders, including the Oscars’ longtime home ABC, ending the network’s streak of hosting the awards show since 1976 (with the exception of a
brief period
in the early 1970s). YouTube’s first show will be the 101st Oscars in 2029, and its deal will run through 2033. ABC will continue to broadcast the ceremony until 2028. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The news, which marks a landmark shift for one of television’s marquee events, highlights YouTube’s
growing dominance in the television space
and a major shift as streaming takes on more live events. The ceremony will be available live and for free to more than 2 billion viewers globally on YouTube, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States. The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences. “We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”
As part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more.</div>

Gemini 3 Flash arrives with reduced costs and latency — a powerful combo for enterprises

Enterprises can now harness the power of a large language model that&#x27;s near that of the state-of-the-art
Google’s Gemini 3 Pro
, but at a fraction of the cost and with increased speed, thanks to the
newly released Gemini 3 Flash
. The model joins the flagship Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and Gemini Agent, all of which were announced and released last month. Gemini 3 Flash, now available on Gemini Enterprise, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, AI Studio, and on preview in Vertex AI, processes information in near real-time and helps build quick, responsive agentic applications. The company
said in a blog post
that Gemini 3 Flash “builds on the model series that developers and enterprises already love, optimized for high-frequency workflows that demand speed, without sacrificing quality. The model is also the default for AI Mode on Google Search and the Gemini application. Tulsee Doshi, senior director, product management on the Gemini team, said in a
separate blog post
that the model “demonstrates that speed and scale don’t have to come at the cost of intelligence.”
“Gemini 3 Flash is made for iterative development, offering Gemini 3’s Pro-grade coding performance with low latency — it’s able to reason and solve tasks quickly in high-frequency workflows,” Doshi said. “It strikes an ideal balance for agentic coding, production-ready systems and responsive interactive applications.”
Early adoption by specialized firms proves the model&#x27;s reliability in high-stakes fields. Harvey, an AI platform for law firms, reported a 7% jump in reasoning on their internal &#x27;BigLaw Bench,&#x27; while Resemble AI discovered that Gemini 3 Flash could process complex forensic data for deepfake detection 4x faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro.</div>

One of the big stories of last year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was the debut of Donut Lab’s
diminutive but powerful electric motors
. When I spoke with Donut earlier this year, the company told me that it was looking at applications ranging from drones to large automotive motors, but also things like wind turbines and even washing machines. Now, almost a year later, we have our first look at an electric vehicle that uses the technology, thanks to a new collaboration between Donut Lab and WATT Electric Vehicle Company. WATT had previously developed the Passenger and Commercial EV
Skateboard
(PACES), a lightweight aluminum platform for low-volume EVs. Now, it’s integrating Donut’s motors, first with one for each rear wheel, although there will eventually be an all-wheel-drive variant, too. The small EV chassis is rather intriguing—with the motors in the rear wheel hubs, the layout is even more space-efficient than a more conventional EV, which still needs to find a few cubic feet to package its drive unit(s).</div>

The Academy and YouTube ink Oscars deal
The 101st Oscars will stream on YouTube
The event has aired on ABC for almost 50 years
And the Oscar goes to... YouTube
. Google
&#x27;s streaming video giant has just secured the 2029 Academy Awards show and the surrounding red-carpet events. The telecast will be leaving Disney-owned ABC, its home since 1976. It&#x27;s a big moment for streaming TV and, perhaps, an unfortunate sign of the times for linear, a.ka. broadcast TV. Just this year,
streaming surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable
(the split is 44.1% for the pair and 44.8% for streaming), according to Nielsen. Live events like the Oscars and sports have been one of the ways in which linear TV still wins, but streamers like Netflix,
Amazon
,
Apple
, and others have been partnering with major sports leagues to bring the live games to their platforms (Apple has the MLB and MLS, Amazon Prime has some NFL games). Award shows, however, had held fast to broadcast and cable – until now. In recent years, Disney has also streamed the Oscars on Disney+ and Hulu.</div>

Amazon’s head of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Rohit Prasad, is leaving the company next year as it reaches an “inflection point” in its development of the technology,
CEO Andy Jassy announced on Wednesday
. As part of the change, Peter DeSantis, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services, will helm a new division focused on the company’s most advanced AI models, chip development, and quantum computing. Prasad joined Amazon in 2013 and played a key role in the evolution of the company’s voice assistant Alexa. He also oversaw the launch of the Amazon Nova AI models and later became the head of the AGI team in 2023.</div>

Study links Amazon&#x27;s algorithmic pricing with erratic, inflated costs for school districts
It also routes public funds away from local businesses and toward overseas ones. Will Shanklin

When it comes to convenience, it’s hard to beat Amazon. And that rationale isn’t limited to consumers: Many local districts shopping for supplies with public funds apply the same logic. But the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR)
published a study
earlier this month (via
The American Prospect
) that illustrates the cost of that bargain. It suggests that Amazon’s “dynamic pricing” has led many schools and other localities to overpay for supplies. Public schools and local governments have historically bought supplies by soliciting competitive bids from local suppliers. Those vendors then respond with fixed price lists, delivery timelines and other terms. This competition — all out in the open, part of the public record — encourages low prices and transparency. On the surface, ordering from Amazon
appears
to offer competition, too. After all, the platform includes third-party vendors fighting for your dollars. But turning taxpayer funds over to Amazon’s algorithms isn’t quite that simple. That’s because the platform’s “dynamic pricing” (algorithmically driven real-time changes) is inherently opaque. Advertisement

According to the report, Amazon’s contracts with public entities don’t include fixed price lists. Instead, they include language built around swings. “This contract has a dynamic pricing structure in which the price for items listed on the online digital marketplace is driven by the market,” Amazon’s contract with Utah reads. “This contract will not need to be amended when prices fluctuate.”
Below are some examples of wild price discrepancies for these districts.</div>

                <div class="summary">AI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past twelve months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.”
The dictionary
defines the term
as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.”
“Like
slime
,
sludge
, and
muck
,
slop
has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology. “It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.”
The word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like
OpenAI’s Sora
and
Google Gemini’s Veo
are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials—even entire movies. One study in May
claimed that
nearly 75 percent of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI. These new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content
can be milked for advertising money
. Critics
worry that
this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them up into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which—as you might imagine—can be quite light on informational value.</div>

We&#x27;ve heard (and written, here at VentureBeat) lots about the generative AI race
between the U.S. and China
, as those have been the countries with the groups most active in fielding new models (with a shoutout to Cohere in Canada and Mistral in France). But now a Korean startup is making waves: last week, the firm known as
Motif Technologies
released
Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning
, another small parameter open-weight model that boasts impressive benchmark scores, quickly becoming the most performant model from that country according to
independent benchmarking lab Artificial Analysis
(beating even regular GPT-5.1 from U.S. leader OpenAI). But more importantly for enterprise AI teams, the company has
published a white paper on arxiv.org
with a concrete, reproducible training recipe that exposes where reasoning performance actually comes from — and where common internal LLM efforts tend to fail. For organizations building or fine-tuning their own models behind the firewall, the paper offers a set of practical lessons about data alignment, long-context infrastructure, and reinforcement learning stability that are directly applicable to enterprise environments. Here they are:
1. Reasoning gains come from data distribution, not model size
One of Motif’s most relevant findings for enterprise teams is that
synthetic reasoning data
only helps when its structure
matches
the
target model’s reasoning style
. The paper shows measurable differences in downstream coding performance depending on which “teacher” model generated the reasoning traces used during supervised fine-tuning. For enterprises, this undermines a common shortcut: generating large volumes of synthetic chain-of-thought data from a frontier model and assuming it will transfer cleanly.</div>

Last month saw
the release of Project Misriah
, an ambitious modding project that tried to recreate the feel of
Halo 3
inside Valve’s
Counter-Strike 2
. That project has now been taken down from the Steam Workshop, though, after drawing a DMCA complaint from Microsoft. Modder Froddoyo
introduced Project Misriah on November 16
as “a workshop collection of
Halo
ported maps and assets that aims to bring a
Halo 3
multiplayer-like experience to
Counter-Strike 2
.” Far from just being inspired by
Halo 3
, the mod directly copied multiple sound effects, character models, maps, and even movement mechanics from Bungie and Microsoft’s popular series. In the weeks since, Project Misriah drew a lot of praise from both
Halo
fans and those impressed by what modders could pull off with the Source 2 engine. But last Wednesday, modder Froddoyo
shared a DMCA request from Microsoft
citing the “unauthorized use of
Halo
game content in a [Steam] workshop not associated with
Halo
games.”
A trailer announcing Project Misriah, posted last month. In a social media post sharing that DMCA text, Froddoyo ruefully said that players should “make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft” for the project’s fate. But in
a comment on Project Misriah’s YouTube trailer
, Froddoyo noted that, following the takedown, the project “will not be worked on or uploaded in the future.</div>

PM9E1 NVMe Gen5 SSD emerged quietly in 2024
, surprising the industry as the company
entered mass production
without a major announcement. This model followed the PM9A1 SSD launched in 2021, introducing improvements in speed, capacity, and power efficiency. The drive measures only 22 by 42 millimeters, a significant reduction compared with previous M.2 2280 designs, yet it integrates a full
