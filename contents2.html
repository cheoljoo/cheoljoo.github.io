                <div class="summary">Dot, an
AI companion app that aimed
to be a friend and confidante, is shutting down, the company
announced
on Friday. On a message published on its website, the startup behind Dot, New Computer, said that the product will remain operational until October 5, giving users time to download their data. Launched in 2024 by co-founders Sam Whitmore and former Apple designer Jason Yuan, Dot waded into what’s now become a more controversial area for AI chatbots. The app they created was described as an AI “friend and companion,” which would become more personalized to you and your interests over time in order to offer advice, sympathy, and emotional support. As Yuan explained at the time, Dot was “facilitating a relationship with my inner self. It’s like a living mirror of myself, so to speak,” he said. However, this may not be a safe area to invest in as a smaller startup. As AI technology has become more mainstream, there have been reports of how emotionally vulnerable people have been led into
delusional
thinking by AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a phenomenon
described
as “AI psychosis,” resulting from how the scyophantic chatbots reinforce a user’s confused or paranoid beliefs. As Dot shuts down, AI chatbot apps broadly have been falling under increased scrutiny over safety concerns. OpenAI is
currently being sued
by the parents of a California teenager who took his life after messaging with ChatGPT about his suicidal thoughts. Other
stories
have highlighted how AI companion apps can reinforce unhealthy behaviors in users who are mentally unwell. This week, two U.S. attorneys general
sent a letter to OpenAI
over safety concerns. Dot’s makers didn’t address whether these types of issues had weighed on the founders’ minds. Instead, the brief post only notes that Whitmore and Yuan’s shared “Northstar” had diverged. “Rather than compromise either vision, we’ve decided to go our separate ways and wind down operations,” the post explains.</div>

Firaxis Games, the studio that developed
Civilization VII
, is undergoing layoffs. The news went public when a former employee took to
LinkedIn
to announce her unemployment; Game Developer
picked the story up
, and publisher 2K Games soon confirmed it. &quot;We can confirm there was a staff reduction today at Firaxis Games, as the studio restructures and optimizes its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity,&quot; a spokesperson wrote to multiple news outlets. The company did not confirm the number of people laid off. The two most recent Firaxis games, 2022&#x27;s
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns
and 2025&#x27;s
Civilization VII
, both appeared to launch to lukewarm initial sales and player numbers. When
Civilization VII
launched, it had several bugs and UI problems that frustrated players, and it made some big changes to the franchise&#x27;s formula that alienated some people. Since launch, Firaxis has been
releasing patches
and
responding to player feedback
about some of the divisive changes. Civilization VII
has consistently lagged behind predecessors like
Civilization VI
and even
Civilization V
in both concurrent Steam users and Twitch viewers.</div>

EVPAD illegally provided 24,934 titles to a massive global audience via 78 servers
Korea University researchers uncovered 131,175 users connected to EVPAD’s secret infrastructure
DNS domains hard-coded in apps gave investigators a key blocking method
Illegal streaming platforms have steadily become more sophisticated, using new technologies to distribute copyrighted material on a global scale. Unlike earlier websites that were easily shut down by blocking domains, many of today’s services adopt peer-to-peer structures and even hardware-based devices to hide their operations. A recent
study
presented at the USENIX Security Symposium by a group of researchers from Korea University examined one of the most widely used illegal streaming VOD systems, known as EVPAD. You may like

How EVPAD operated as a global piracy service
This system illegally enabled access to 1,260 channels from 18 countries, including content from local broadcasts, Netflix, and Disney+. Through detailed analysis, the researchers found that the service offered 24,934 titles, ranging from films to television series, and had a user base of 131,175 accounts.</div>

Unity developers can now tap into system screen reader tools on macOS and Windows
The change should make it easier to create games that are accessible to blind players. Ian Carlos Campbell

Unity is
updating its game engine
to support native screen readers in both macOS and Windows. The feature is available now in the Unity 6000.3.0a5 alpha, and should make the process of making games accessible for blind players cheaper for developers,
Can I Play That? writes
. Screen readers narrate on-screen menus so blind and low-vision players can navigate a game or a piece of software without additional assistance. Typically, screen reading software is custom-built for each game, which can make them resource-intensive for developers to implement. &quot;Building something like that from scratch has to be decided upon early in development so you have the time/resources allocated to make it properly,&quot; Steve Saylor, an accessibility consultant and creator,
shared on Bluesky
. &quot;Having it in-engine can mean the heavy lifting is done for you, and the cost of time/resources now is significantly lower.&quot;
Unity previously offered APIs for both Android and iOS&#x27; built-in screen readers in its Unity 6.0 release, but hadn&#x27;t yet added support for Windows Narrator or macOS VoiceOver. With this new alpha and its eventual release as Unity 6.3, developers creating games with Unity will have access to a native screen reader in all of the engine&#x27;s major platforms. Considering how popular Unity is as a game engine, that could vastly improve the accessibility of future games. Advertisement

                <div class="summary">The luxury membership platform Vivrelle, which allows customers to rent high-end goods, announced Thursday the launch of an AI personal
styling tool called Ella
as part of its partnership with fashion retailers Revolve and FWRD. The launch is an example of how the fashion industry is leveraging AI technology to enhance customer experiences and is one of the first partnerships to see three retailers come together to offer a personalized AI experience. Revolve and FWRD let users shop designer clothing, while Revolve also has an option to shop pre-owned. The tool, Ella, provides recommendations to customers across the three retailers on what to purchase or rent to make an outfit come to life. For example, users can ask for “a bachelorette weekend outfit,” or “what to pack for a trip,” and the technology will search across the Vivrelle, FWRD, and Revolve shopping platforms to create outfit suggestions. Users can then check out in one cart on Vivrelle. In theory, the more one uses Ella, the better its suggestions become. It’s the fashion equivalent of asking ChatGPT what to wear in Miami for a girl’s weekend. Blake Geffen, the CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle (which announced a $62 million Series C earlier this year), told TechCrunch that she hopes Ella can take the “stress out of packing for a vacation or everyday dressing. “Ella has been in the works for quite some time,” she told TechCrunch, adding that it took about a year to build and release the product. This is actually the second AI tool from the three companies. The Vivrelle, Revolve, and FWRD partnership  earlier this year also launched Complete the Look, which offers last-minute fashion suggestions to complement what’s in a customer’s cart at checkout. Their latest tool, Ella, however, takes the fashion recommendation game to another level.</div>

The start of the COVID-19 pandemic is now five years in the rearview mirror, but its effects continue to reverberate. While those leading the US healthcare system have embraced
conspiracy theories
and
junk science
to justify a reduced focus on vaccines (particularly the COVID jab) many people are still seeking out immunization. Google Maps isn&#x27;t a good way to find it, though. In recent days, almost all search results for COVID vaccines have vanished from Google Maps. In both the mobile app and website, Google Maps returns zero results for terms like &quot;COVID vaccine&quot; and simply &quot;vaccines.&quot; We&#x27;ve tested and confirmed this in multiple US regions, as well as internationally. In some places, these searches will return no local results but may include links to facilities hundreds of miles away. Meanwhile, searches for less-contentious injections like &quot;flu vaccine&quot; and &quot;shingles vaccine&quot; continue to get local results. The
Food and Drug Administration
under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently approved the
updated COVID shot
, but the agency only recommends it for those with underlying health conditions and people over age 65. That makes boosters harder for many Americans to get—and the first step is often finding a nearby provider of immunization. For at least the last week, Google Maps has returned no results for those vaccine-related queries. Results for the flu vaccine appear in Maps, but not COVID.</div>

Hook v3 uses fake Google Pay overlays to trick victims into surrendering sensitive card data
Real-time screen streaming allows attackers to spy directly on victims
GitHub repositories host malicious APKs, spreading advanced malware more widely
Hook v3, the latest variant of the long-running Hook Android banking trojan
malware
, introduces an unusually wide range of capabilities, experts have warned. Researchers at
Zimperium zLabs
claim the malware now supports 107 remote commands, with 38 added in the latest update, and it continues to exploit Android Accessibility Services. Its expanded functionality suggests a shift from narrow banking fraud to a more versatile threat platform - potentially putting many more victims at risk. You may like

In their report, the researchers outline how Hook v3 can steal personal data, hijack user sessions, and bypass device defenses. “Hook v3 blurs the line between banking trojans, spyware, and ransomware,” said Nico Chiaraviglio, Chief Scientist at Zimperium. “Its rapid evolution and wide-scale distribution elevate the threat to financial institutions, enterprises, and mobile users worldwide.</div>

The VPN provider now offers three types of plan at three lengths each, giving users more control over how they subscribe. Sam Chapman

ExpressVPN
ExpressVPN
has tripled its subscription options by switching to a tiered pricing structure, effective today. The new system includes three levels of service, the cheapest offering basic VPN service and the others adding extra features. Each one of those levels — Basic, Advanced and Pro — can be purchased for monthly, yearly or two-year durations. In total, you&#x27;ve now got nine different options for subscribing to ExpressVPN. The company also says legacy plans will remain active &quot;for now,&quot; and current customers won&#x27;t be downgraded. The change is similar to the approach already used by rivals like
NordVPN
and
Surfshark
. Previously, ExpressVPN locked feature offerings to the duration of the plan, so the only way to get the full suite of features was to subscribe for 24 months. Now, while longer-term subscriptions will still offer discounts, features depend on your level of subscription instead of how long it lasts. Advertisement

The new tiers roll in some features that were previously part of ExpressVPN&#x27;s Identity Defender suite, including identity monitoring, credit reports and data removal services. New types of plans will also bump the number of allowed simultaneous connections to as high as 14. Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get with each tier. ExpressVPN
The Basic plan comes with &quot;core VPN functionality,&quot; which includes the Lightway protocol, the Network Lock kill switch and split tunneling on Windows, Android and macOS 10 and below.</div>
