                <div class="summary">This is a summary of the article. The original article discusses Months before a jury awarded a $242.5 million verdict against Tesla over its culpability in a 2019 fatal crash, the automaker had a chance to settle for $60 million. Instead, Tesla rejected that offer, according to new legal filings that were first
reported by Reuters
.
The settlement proposal, which was made in May, was disclosed in a filing that requested Tesla cover legal fees for the plaintiffs in the case.
Earlier this month, a jury in federal court in Miami found Tesla
partly to blame
for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system. One person was killed when a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged plowed through an intersection and hit a Chevrolet Tahoe. The crash victims, Neima Benavides Leon and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, were standing outside the vehicle on the shoulder at the time. Leon was killed while Angulo was severely injured.
The driver, who was not a defendant in this case, was sued separately for his responsibility. The lawsuit filed in 2021 against Tesla centered on Autopilot, which was engaged but did not brake in time to avoid going through the intersection. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame and attributed one-third to Tesla. As part of the verdict, the jury awarded the $242.5 million verdict as part of its decision.
Tesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch earlier this month, said it plans to appeal the verdict “given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.”
TechCrunch has reached out to the plaintiffs’ attorneys as well as Tesla. An outside PR firm that previously provided statements on Tesla’s behalf declined to comment and directed TechCrunch to the company’s press address. Tesla disbanded its communications team several years ago.
The lawsuit, case 1:21-cv-21940-BB, was filed in 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Android&#x27;s open nature set it apart from the iPhone as the era of touchscreen smartphones began nearly two decades ago. Little by little, Google has traded some of that openness for security, and its next security initiative could make the biggest concessions yet in the name of blocking bad apps. Google has announced plans to begin verifying the identities of all Android app developers, and not just those publishing on the Play Store. Google intends to
verify developer identities no matter where they offer their content
, and apps without verification won&#x27;t work on most Android devices in the coming years.
Google used to do very little curation of the Play Store (or Android Market, if you go back far enough), but it has long sought to improve the platform&#x27;s reputation as being less secure than the Apple App Store. Years ago, you could publish actual exploits in the official store to gain root access on phones, but now there are multiple reviews and detection mechanisms to reduce the prevalence of malware and banned content. While the Play Store is
still not perfect
, Google claims apps sideloaded from outside its store are 50 times more likely to contain malware.
This, we are led to believe, is the impetus for Google&#x27;s new developer verification system. The company describes it like an &quot;ID check at the airport.&quot; Since requiring all Google Play app developers to verify their identities in 2023, it has seen a precipitous drop in malware and fraud. ...</div>

Imgur protest covers the front page in anti-MediaLab memes
The community has some choice words for the owner of the image-sharing site.

Imgur
Despite all the division and controversy rife in the modern era, sometimes the Internet does manage to collectively agree on something. Right now, they agree that they hate Imgur parent company
MediaLab
.
After being
acquired
by MediaLab in 2021, the once famously open-to-anything image-sharing service began placing
restrictions
on content in 2023. More recently, the site has experienced service issues, including problems with notifications. Many members of the Imgur community have
claimed
that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is
deleting
or
hiding
content that is critical of the owner and its policies.
The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab&#x27;s poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.

                <div class="summary">Pintarnya, an Indonesian employment and financial services platform, has secured $16.7 million in a Series A funding round led by Square Peg. Founded in 2022, the company aims to address the challenges faced by Indonesia&#x27;s mass workers in finding jobs and accessing responsible lending. Co-founder Henry Hendrawan explained that the platform digitizes job matching with AI and provides safer, affordable lending options, moving away from traditional offline job searches and predatory lenders. A significant portion of Indonesia&#x27;s workforce is in the informal sector, lacking the documentation needed for formal financial services. Pintarnya overcomes this by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans. Since its 2022 seed funding, the platform has grown to serve over 10 million job seekers and 40,000 employers, with revenue increasing nearly fivefold year-over-year. The company anticipates reaching break-even by the end of the year.</div>

                <div class="summary">A significant portion of a software developer&#x27;s time, as much as 84%, is spent on non-coding tasks, with context switching being a major drain on productivity. Research indicates that the average digital worker switches between applications up to 1,200 times daily, and it can take over 20 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption. This constant shifting between tools is a primary obstacle to efficiency. To address this, a new protocol from Anthropic, called MCP, is being explored. The goal is to keep developers within their integrated development environment (IDE) where they are most productive. By bringing necessary context directly into the IDE, MCP aims to reduce the need for developers to switch between different platforms, thereby optimizing their workflow and reclaiming a large portion of the time currently lost to operational and supportive tasks.</div>

The rocket, standing at 404 feet (123.1 meters), is the largest of its kind ever constructed. An initial launch attempt on Sunday was scrubbed due to a ground system issue, with the next opportunity as early as Monday evening. This flight is the fourth for an upgraded version of Starship, which is a step towards a more reliable rocket capable of carrying up to 150 metric tons of cargo. The planned 66-minute flight is set to conclude with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean, northwest of Australia.</div>

Di Benedetto, expresses a long-held desire for a unified, upgradeable PC gaming setup that can be used anywhere, especially in the living room. While acknowledging the Steam Deck as a great handheld device, he finds it lacks the power needed for a seamless TV gaming experience. Previous attempts with gaming laptops and traditional desktops have been unsatisfactory due to noise, bulk, and the inconvenience of using Windows on a TV. The author reflects on the failure of Valve&#x27;s Steam Machine project, which he had hoped would be the solution. Now, he sees a new, promising path forward by combining the Framework Desktop with a Linux-based operating system called Bazzite, suggesting this combination comes very close to realizing the dream of a versatile, living-room-friendly PC gaming console.</div>
