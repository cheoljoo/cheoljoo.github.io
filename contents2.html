                <div class="summary">On November 30, 2022, OpenAI introduced a new product to the world, innocuously
describing it
as “a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.”
It’s no hyperbole to suggest that ChatGPT subsequently transformed the worlds of business and tech, becoming enormously popular — it’s still in the number one spot on Apple’s free app rankings today — while also serving as the catalyst for a flood of generative AI products.
It’s even made people
suspicious of the em dash
, which no chatbot will ever take from me.
In fact, “Empire of AI” author
Karen Hao argued in a recent interview with TechCrunch
that OpenAI has “already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation-state in the world,” and is now “rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives.”
There may be even more dramatic changes to come. Charlie Warzel
wrote in The Atlantic
that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.”
“Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.”
Of course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.”

Ontology is the real guardrail: How to stop AI agents from misunderstanding your business
Dattaraj Rao, Persistent Systems
November 30, 2025
Enterprises are investing billions of dollars in AI agents and infrastructure to transform business processes. However, we are seeing limited success in real-world applications, often due to the inability of agents to truly
understand business data
, policies and processes.
While we manage the integrations well with technologies like API management, model context protocol (MCP) and others, having agents truly understand the “meaning” of data in the context of a given businesis a different story. Enterprise data is mostly siloed into disparate systems in structured and unstructured forms and needs to be analyzed with a domain-specific business lens.s
As an example, the term “customer” may refer to a different group of people in a Sales CRM system, compared to a finance system which may use this tag for paying clients. One department might define “product” as a SKU; another may represent as a &quot;product&quot; family; a third as a marketing bundle.
Data about “product sales” thus varies in meaning without agreed upon relationships and definitions. For agents to combine data from multiple systems, they must understand different representations. Agents need to know what the data means in context and how to find the right data for the right process. Moreover, schema changes in systems and data quality issues during collection can lead to more ambiguity and inability of agents to know how to act when such situations are encountered.
Furthermore, classification of data into categories like PII (personally identifiable information) needs to be rigorously followed to maintain compliance with standards like GDPR and CCPA. This requires the data to be labelled correctly and agents to be able to understand and respect this classification.</div>

We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, from modern to ancient and all points in between. With that in mind, we’ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a
curated list of some of our favorites from GOG’s catalog
. At the end of every month, we’ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.
Twice a month, we’ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we’ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you’ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out
the earlier pieces in the series
!
Boy, was 1992 a different time for computer games. Epic MegaGames’
Jill of the Jungle
illustrates that as well as any other title from the era. Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.)
Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time.</div>

Windows 11 migration remains slow as companies continue relying on aging hardware fleets
Dell sees flat PC sales ahead while server demand shows clear growth
Memory prices rise sharply as manufacturers shift resources toward AI-focused components
Dell
is warning the
shift from Windows 10 to Windows 11
remains far behind expectations.
As part of its most recent financial results, the company revealed the current transition rate is ten to twelve points lower than the pace seen during the previous
operating system
phase-out.
For this reason, Dell expects flat PC sales next year, even though about 500 million PCs cannot run
Windows 11
due to hardware limitations.

Many of these systems remain functional enough that organizations have delayed replacement, Dell says, a mood which seems to affect every segment, from desktops to smaller systems such as a
mini PC
.
Dell reported stronger results from its server and networking units as orders for AI-focused systems reached more than twelve billion dollars in the last quarter.</div>

Black Friday is done, but the sales still roll on, and
Cyber Monday
remains a decent chance to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC,
PS5
,
gaming handheld
or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Cyber Monday SSD deals and other storage discounts you can still get right now. It&#x27;s not the most plentiful time for SSD deals more generally these days, but we&#x27;re still seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed
internal drives
,
portable SSDs
and
microSD cards
. We&#x27;ll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time.
Best Cyber Monday microSD card deals
Nintendo
Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 (256GB)
$39
$60
Save $21
The only reason to buy a super-fast (and pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a
Nintendo Switch 2
, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the
best Switch 2 microSD cards
, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. For Cyber Monday, that’s Samsung’s officially licensed card, provided you can live with 256GB of space. This discount marks a new all-time low. Also at

New York state law takes aim at personalized pricing
New York’s latest state budget includes new disclosure requirements for businesses that use personal data to set different prices for different shoppers — for example, charging you more if you have a history of splurging.
Businesses that use personalized pricing are now required to tell customers, “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data,”
according to The New York Times
.
It’s not clear how widespread this practice actually is among online retailers. An Uber spokesperson told the NYT that the company is now showing this disclosure to New Yorkers, although they described the law as “poorly drafted and ambiguous” and insisted that Uber only uses geography and customer demand to calculate its dynamic pricing.
The National Retail Federation filed a lawsuit to stop the law, but a federal judge allowed it to move forward.
Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and now co-chair of
the mayoral transition team for Zohran Mamdani
, told the NYT that the law will be an “absolutely vital” tool for the government, but she also suggested there’s a “ton more work to be done” to regulate the practice.

Why observable AI is the missing SRE layer enterprises need for reliable LLMs
SaiKrishna Koorapati
November 29, 2025
CleoPtolemy made with Midjourney
As AI systems enter production, reliability and governance can’t depend on wishful thinking. Here’s how observability turns
large language models (LLMs)
into auditable, trustworthy enterprise systems.
Why observability secures the future of enterprise AI
The enterprise race to deploy LLM systems mirrors the early days of cloud adoption. Executives love the promise; compliance demands accountability; engineers just want a paved road.
Yet, beneath the excitement, most leaders admit they can’t trace how AI decisions are made, whether they helped the business, or if they broke any rule.
Take one Fortune 100 bank that deployed an LLM to classify loan applications.
Benchmark accuracy
looked stellar. Yet, 6 months later, auditors found that 18% of critical cases were misrouted, without a single alert or trace. The root cause wasn’t bias or bad data. It was invisible. No observability, no accountability.
If you can’t observe it, you can’t trust it. And unobserved AI will fail in silence.
Visibility isn’t a luxury; it’s the foundation of trust. Without it, AI becomes ungovernable.
Start with outcomes, not models
Most corporate AI projects begin with tech leaders choosing a model and, later, defining success metrics.
That’s backward.
Flip the order:
Define the outcome first.
What’s the measurable business goal?
Deflect 15 % of billing calls
Reduce document review time by 60 %
Cut case-handling time by two minutes
Design telemetry around that outcome,
not around “accuracy” or “BLEU score.”
Select prompts, retrieval methods and models
that demonstrably move those KPIs.
At one global insurer, for instance, reframing success as “minutes saved per claim” instead of “model precision” turned an isolated pilot into a company-wide roadmap.</div>

Achieving lasting remission for HIV
Promising trials using engineered antibodies suggest that “functional cures” may be in reach.

Around the world, some 40 million people are living with HIV. And though progress in treatment means the infection isn’t the death sentence it once was, researchers have never been able to bring about a cure. Instead, HIV-positive people must take a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives.
But in 2025, researchers reported a breakthrough that suggests that a “functional” cure for HIV—a way to keep HIV under control long-term without constant treatment—may indeed be possible. In two independent trials using infusions of engineered antibodies, some participants remained healthy without taking antiretrovirals, long after the interventions ended.
In one of the trials—the
FRESH trial
, led by virologist Thumbi Ndung’u of the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa—four of 20 participants maintained undetectable levels of HIV for a median of 1.5 years without taking antiretrovirals.</div>

Although the day itself may be over for another year, there&#x27;s no shortage of
Black Friday tech deals
still going strong throughout the weekend.
Black Friday VPN deals
are no exception. Many of the biggest
VPN
providers on the planet have dropped their prices significantly this year and are still giving you the opportunity to download a bargain.
Among them is
Norton VPN
, which has guaranteed that its VPN deal – with up to 72% off and costing
as little as $2.08/£2.08 per month
– will continue to run
until Tuesday, December 2
.
And because Norton offers a generous 60-day money-back guarantee, you can strike while the pricing is hot with the confidence of knowing that you can get every cent back if you change your mind later.
You can discover all of Norton&#x27;s Black Friday VPN pricing below. Or, you&#x27;re keen to sign up straight away,

Norton VPN Standard
We retested Norton VPN in full earlier this year and were impressed with what we found. It had come on leaps and bounds since the last time we reviewed it, scoring a solid 4 stars out of 5 thanks to its &quot;fast speeds, simple apps, and impressive unblocking&quot;.
Despite being the cybersecurity company&#x27;s entry-level package, the Norton VPN Standard plan still throws in website unblocking on five devices, access to its proprietary
Mimic protocol
, privacy reassurances from its kill switch and
Double VPN and IP Rotation tools
, and an integrated ad blocker – all on top of industry-standard encryption.
