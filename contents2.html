announced
on Wednesday a new integration with Spotify, bringing a seamless ticket-buying experience for Spotify users. Now, when Spotify users browse an artist’s page or upcoming tour dates, they will see ticket links powered by SeatGeek for concerts at these participating venues, allowing for a streamlined purchase process. Currently, the integration is available for a select group of venues where SeatGeek serves as the primary ticket seller. Specifically, it covers SeatGeek’s 15 major U.S. venue partners, including State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Nissan Stadium in Nashville, and AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington. (So, although SeatGeek is a major player in the secondary ticketing space, this integration is exclusive to venues where it operates as the primary ticketing platform.)
This is a strategic win for SeatGeek. With direct placement in the Spotify app, SeatGeek is positioned to reach millions of active music fans as they discover upcoming events, increasing the chances of converting listeners into ticket buyers. Image Credits:
SeatGeek
Although SeatGeek has made significant strides in the space, it continues to face competition from heavyweights Ticketmaster and AXS. These rivals command a greater share of the ticketing market, bolstered by long-term contracts with many top venues and event organizers. It’s
estimated
that Ticketmaster alone services 53 of the top 68 US arenas. Even Barclays Center, which switched from Ticketmaster to SeatGeek in 2021,
quickly reversed course
less than a year into a seven-year agreement and ended the deal to return to Ticketmaster. Notably, the latest partnership follows Spotify’s
announcement
that it has helped artists generate over $1 billion in ticket sales by linking fans with live events through its ticketing partners. The company works with more than 45
ticketing partners
, including Ticketmaster, AXS, Eventbrite, DICE, a...</div>

Alibaba dropped Qwen3.5
earlier this week, timed to coincide with the Lunar New Year, and the headline numbers alone are enough to make enterprise AI buyers stop and pay attention. The new flagship open-weight model — Qwen3.5-397B-A17B — packs 397 billion total parameters but activates only 17 billion per token. It is claiming benchmark wins against
Alibaba&#x27;s own previous flagship, Qwen3-Max
, a model the company itself has acknowledged exceeded one trillion parameters. The release marks a meaningful moment in enterprise AI procurement. For IT leaders evaluating AI infrastructure for 2026, Qwen 3.5 presents a different kind of argument: that the model you can actually run, own, and control can now trade blows with the models you have to rent. A New Architecture Built for Speed at Scale
The engineering story underneath Qwen3.5 starts with its ancestry. The model is a direct successor to last September&#x27;s experimental Qwen3-Next, an ultra-sparse MoE model that was previewed but widely regarded as half-trained. Qwen3.5 takes that architectural direction and scales it aggressively, jumping from 128 experts in the previous Qwen3 MoE models to 512 experts in the new release. The practical implication of this and a better attention mechanism is dramatically lower inference latency. Because only 17 billion of those 397 billion parameters are active for any given forward pass, the compute footprint is far closer to a 17B dense model than a 400B one — while the model can draw on the full depth of its expert pool for specialized reasoning. These speed gains are substantial. At 256K context lengths, Qwen 3.5 decodes 19 times faster than Qwen3-Max and 7.2 times faster than Qwen 3&#x27;s 235B-A22B model.</div>

This week, Apple released the first developer betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, macOS 26.4, and its other operating systems. On Tuesday, it followed those up with public beta versions of the same updates. Usually released around the midpoint between one major iOS release and the next, the *.4 updates to its operating system usually include a significant batch of new features and other refinements, and if the first beta is any indication, this year’s releases uphold that tradition. A new “Playlist Playground” feature will let Apple Music subscribers generate playlists with text prompts, and native support for video podcasts is coming to the Podcasts app. The
Creator Studio version
of the Freeform drawing and collaboration app is also available in the 26.4 updates, allowing subscribers to access stock images from Apple’s Content Hub and to insert AI-generated images. But we’ve spent time digging through the betas to identify some of the more below-the-surface improvements and changes that Apple is testing. Some of these changes won’t come to the public versions of the software until a later release; others may be removed or changed between now and when the 26.4 update is made available to the general public. But generally, Apple’s betas give us a good idea of what the final release will look like. One feature that hasn’t appeared in these betas? The new “more intelligent Siri” that ...</div>

If you know where to look, you can often score deals on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the
AirPods Max
and
AirPods 4
(with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the newer
AirPods Pro 3
. And while more recent shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday delivered some of the steepest discounts we’ve seen, there are still good deals to be found on every model. Related

Cyberpunk platformer Replaced has once again been delayed
It&#x27;s now scheduled to come out on April 14. Lawrence Bonk

The long-awaited cyberpunk platformer
Replaced
just got hit with a short delay
. The pixel-art game
was supposed to come out on March 12
, but will now be released on April 14. That&#x27;s just a month, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal considering this game has been
on our radar for five years
. Why the delay? Developer Sad Cat Studios notes that the game is &quot;technically finished&quot; but the team needs a few more weeks for polish. The company says it wants the day-one release to be &quot;polished, stable and true to the vision&quot; of the original concept. This is something to be commended, in my opinion,
given the sad state
of many game launches
in recent years
. This is just the
latest delay for the game
. However, previous delays have been for a very good reason. The development team had to relocate from Belarus to Cyprus after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Advertisement

Replaced
is an absolutely gorgeous-looking 2.5D platformer set in a dystopian alternative 1980s America. You play as an AI unwillingly trapped in a human body. There looks to be plenty of cinematic action, with a blurb promising a combination of &quot;precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks.&quot;
The game will be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG and the Microsoft Store. It&#x27;ll also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass release. Advertisement

                <div class="summary">The race to advance conversational AI in the living room is heating up, with YouTube being the latest to expand its tool to smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices.
This experimental feature, previously limited to mobile devices and the web, now brings conversational AI directly to the largest screen in the home, allowing users to ask questions about content without leaving the video they’re watching.
According to YouTube’s
support page
, eligible users can click the “Ask” button on their TV screen to summon the AI assistant. The feature offers suggested questions based on the video, or users can use their remote’s microphone button to ask anything related to the video. For instance, they might ask about recipe ingredients or the background of a song’s lyrics, and receive instant answers without pausing or leaving the app.
Currently, this feature is available to a select group of users over 18 and supports English, Hindi, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean.
YouTube first launched this
conversational AI tool
in 2024 to help viewers explore content in greater depth. The expansion to TVs comes as more Americans now access YouTube through their television than ever before. A
Nielsen report
from April 2025 found that YouTube accounted for 12.4% of total television audience time, surpassing major platforms like Disney and Netflix.
Other companies are also making significant strides with their conversational AI technologies. Amazon rolled out
Alexa+ on Fire TV devices
, enabling users to engage in natural conversations and ask Alexa+ for tailored content recommendations, hunt for specific scenes in movies, or even ask questions about actors and filming locations.
Meanwhile,
Roku
has enhanced its AI voice assistant to handle open-ended questions about movies and shows, such as “What’s this movie about?” or “How scary is it?”
Netflix
is also testing its AI search experience.

                <div class="summary">How attackers hit 700 organizations through CX platforms your SOC already approved
Louis Columbus
February 19, 2026
CX platforms process billions of unstructured interactions a year: Survey forms, review sites, social feeds, call center transcripts, all flowing into AI engines that trigger automated workflows touching payroll, CRM, and payment systems. No tool in a security operation center leader’s stack inspects what a CX platform’s AI engine is ingesting, and attackers figured this out. They poison the data feeding it, and the AI does the damage for them.
The Salesloft/Drift breach in August 2025 proved exactly this. Attackers
compromised Salesloft’s GitHub environment
, stole Drift chatbot OAuth tokens, and
accessed Salesforce environments
across 700+ organizations, including Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler. It then
scanned stolen data
for AWS keys, Snowflake tokens, and plaintext passwords. And no malware was deployed.
That gap is wider than most security leaders realize: 98% of organizations have a data loss prevention (DLP) program, but
only 6% have dedicated resources
, according to Proofpoint’s 2025 Voice of the CISO report, which surveyed 1,600 CISOs across 16 countries. And 81% of interactive intrusions
now use legitimate access
rather than malware, per CrowdStrike’s 2025 Threat Hunting Report. Cloud intrusions surged 136% in the first half of 2025.
“Most security teams still classify experience management platforms as ‘survey tools,’ which sit in the same risk tier as a project management app,” Assaf Keren, chief security officer at Qualtrics and former CISO at PayPal, told VentureBeat in a recent interview. “This is a massive miscategorization. These platforms now connect to HRIS, CRM, and compensation engines.” Qualtrics alone processes
3.5 billion interactions annually
, a figure the company says has doubled since 2023. Organizations
can&#x27;t afford to skip steps
on input integrity once AI enters the workflow.

It’s just two weeks until F1 gets underway in Australia, and teams are currently in Bahrain, midway through their third and final preseason test. The 2026 season promises to be
wildly different
from those of the past few years, with all-new cars, engines, hybrid systems, and sustainable fuels entering the mix and shaking up the established order.
You shouldn’t read too much into times from preseason testing. The cars don’t have to conform to the in-season rules as teams test new components or fit-test rigs; for example, glowing brake discs could once again be seen on some cars that weren’t running wheel covers at an earlier test, something we’re unlikely to see during actual races.
You also don’t know how much fuel—and therefore extra weight—anyone is carrying. In the past, some teams have even made headlines by running too light to set more competitive lap times in an effort to impress potential sponsors. And as the name explains, it’s a test, so drivers will be following run plans devised with their engineers to learn specific things about their new cars. Or as one Internet wag once put it, the times mean as much as “a bacon briefcase.”
All change
That said, the tests are far from meaningless, particularly this year. Aft...</div>

AI data center demand is reducing the memory supply for consumer devices
Refurbished PC sales increased 7% across major European markets
40% of refurbished laptops sell between €200 and €300 — a much cheaper option for consumers
Anyone shopping for a new PC in 2026 will likely face higher prices and tighter supply conditions than in recent years due to chip shortages, experts have warned.
Memory manufacturers are allocating more production capacity to high-margin components destined for AI
data centers
rather than modules typically used in mainstream PCs and
smartphones
.
That shift is contributing to sustained pricing pressure across consumer hardware categories, with little evidence that relief is imminent.
