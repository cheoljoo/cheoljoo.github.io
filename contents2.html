                <div class="summary">Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like
high-throughput screening
, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process.
Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company
completed its Series B
, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion.
Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a
deal
in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules.
It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia
on a $1 billion partnership
to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development.
The industry isn’t
without its detractors

Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup,
Listen Labs
, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s
$100 million offers
seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a
billboard in San Francisco
displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by
Ribbit Capital
with participation from
Evantic
and existing investors
Sequoia Capital
,
Conviction
, and
Pear VC
. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.
&quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&quot;

Big Tech’s AI-fueled memory shortage
is set to be the PC industry’s defining story for 2026 and beyond. Standalone, direct-to-consumer RAM kits were some of the first products to feel the bite, with prices spiking by 300 or 400 percent
by the end of 2025
; prices for SSDs had also increased noticeably, albeit more modestly.
The rest of 2026 is going to be all about where, how, and to what extent those price spikes flow downstream into
computers
, phones, and other components that use RAM and NAND chips—areas where the existing supply of products and longer-term supply contracts negotiated by big companies have helped keep prices from surging too noticeably so far.
This week, we’re seeing signs that the RAM crunch is starting to affect the GPU market—Asus made some waves when it inadvertently
announced
that it was discontinuing its
GeForce RTX 5070 Ti
.
Though the company has tried to walk this announcement back since then, if you’re a GPU manufacturer, there’s a strong argument to be made for either discontinuing this model or de-prioritizing it in favor of other GPUs. The 5070 Ti uses 16GB of GDDR7, plus a partially disabled ve...</div>

Big Tech, AI firms, and search engines all help to fund Wikipedia
The Wikimedia Foundation has seven data centers globally
Perplexity has gifted Wikipedia editors 2,500 free Enterprise seats
Tech giants including Ecosia,
Microsoft
, Mistral AI, Perplexity, Pleias, and ProRata are some of the latest companies to have signed up to pay the Wikimedia Foundation an undisclosed amount for premium access to Wikipedia content, the body
announced
in a post to commemorate its 25-year anniversary.
Amazon
,
Google
, and Meta, some of the Foundation&#x27;s earlier members, have already been using the commercial API to to &quot;access content from Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed.&quot;
This revenue is designed to support Wikimedia&#x27;s nonprofit mission and long-term sustainability, but there&#x27;s also a bigger AI story at play.

creators just days after allowing them to publish experiences with in-game transactions. Beginning January 20th, experiences — which Epic Games calls “islands” — will not be able to offer in-island transactions as “a ‘spin’ or ‘increased luck’ for a prize wheel,” according to

If you&#x27;re looking to up your privacy game on the internet in the new year, you can do so for a little less than usual thanks to
ExpressVPN&#x27;s
latest deal. Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period.
We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#x27;s our current pick for

. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.
