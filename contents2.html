The next big trend in AI providers appears to be &quot;studio&quot; environments on the web that allow users to spin up agents and AI applications within minutes.
Case in point, today the well-funded French AI startup
Mistral launched its own Mistral AI Studio
, a new production platform designed to help enterprises build, observe, and operationalize AI applications at scale atop Mistral&#x27;s growing family of proprietary and open source large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.
It&#x27;s an evolution of its legacy API and AI building platorm, &quot;
Le Platforme
,&quot; initially launched in late 2023, and that brand name is being retired for now.

The move comes just days after U.S. rival
Google updated its AI Studio,
also launched in late 2023, to be easier for non-developers to use and build and deploy apps with natural language, aka &quot;vibe coding.&quot;
But while Google&#x27;s update appears to target novices who want to tinker around, Mistral appears more fully focused on building an easy-to-use enterprise AI app development and launchpad, which may require some technical knowledge or familiarity with LLMs, but far less than that of a seasoned developer.
In other words, those outside the tech team at your enterprise could potentially use this to build and test simple apps, tools, and workflows — all powered by E.U.-native AI models operating on E.U.-based infrastructure.
That may be a welcome change for companies concerned about the political situation in the U.S., or who have large operations in Europe and prefer to give their business to homegrown alternatives to U.S. and Chines...</div>

Yesterday, Donald Trump
announced on social media
that he had been planning to “surge” troops into San Francisco this weekend—but was dissuaded from doing so by several tech billionaires.
“Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump wrote.
Who are these “friends”? Trump named “great people like [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang, [Salesforce CEO] Marc Benioff, and others” who told him that “the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!”
Ludicrously wealthy tech execs have exerted unparalleled sway over Trump in the last year. Not content with obsequious flattery—at one
recent White House dinner
, Sam Altman called Trump “a pro-business, pro-innovation president” who was “a very refreshing change,” while Tim Cook praised the legendarily mercurial Trump’s “focus and your leadership”—tech leaders have also
given Trump shiny awards
,
built him a bulletproof ballroom
, and
donated massive sums
to help him get elected.
Most of these execs also have major business before the federal government and have specific “asks” around AI regulation, crypto, tariffs, regulations, and government contracts.
Now, tech execs are even helping to shape the militarization of American cities.
Consider Benioff, for instance. On October 10, he

in which he spoke to a reporter ...</div>

                <div class="summary">TechRadar Verdict
It may not hit every note perfectly, but Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is an honest, heavy, and deeply human look at Bruce Springsteen during arguably one of his darkest periods, one that still showcases the music-making process with just a taste of E Street Band greatness. Ultimately, an antithesis of most biopics, and that&#x27;s a good thing.
Pros
+
Intimate, deeply human look at Bruce during a dark period.
+
Strong performances from Jeremy Allen White and Jeremy Strong
+
Honest, emotionally authentic storytelling
+
Excellent audio mixing
Cons
-
Allen White isn’t Bruce, which may feel off to some
-
Slow pacing at times

For the
Bruce Springsteen
faithful – and probably those who feel that way about Jeremy Allen White – today, October 24, 2025, has been a long time coming, as
Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere
is finally showing in movie theaters across the globe.
Now, for lack of a better analogy, the Boss has been the soundtrack of my life – well, for most of it – so I headed to a local AMC Theatre with Dolby Cinema in the great state of New Jersey for an opening-night preview screening.
I had a lot of feelings going in, especially since
Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere
isn’t like most biopics. But I wouldn’t even call it that, because it focuses on a very specific, short time in Springsteen’s career. Instead of portraying the many months spent on getting
Born to Run
just right or even
Born in the U.S.A.

Mouse: P.I. for Hire arrives in March 2026
Prepare for Troy Baker&#x27;s long-awaited turn as a cartoon mouse.

Add Engadget on Google
Fumi Games / Steam
We finally have a release date for
Mouse: P.I. for Hire
. The delightfully animated game, which marks Troy Baker&#x27;s first time playing a rodent private eye, is slated for March 19, 2026.
Based on its trailers, you&#x27;d be forgiven for viewing
Mouse: P.I. for Hire
as
Cuphead
meets
Doom
. Although it does include FPS action, Engadget&#x27;s Jessica Conditt discovered
surprising depth behind its whimsical brutality
. The game &quot;has more to offer than shock-value cartoon violence,&quot; she wrote. &quot;This is a clue-gathering, photo-snapping, girlfriend-avenging, noir detective simulator that happens to star a bunch of slick-talking mice and rats, and I&#x27;m fully into it.&quot;
Baker
plays Private Investigator Jack Pepper
, the game&#x27;s protagonist. When he isn&#x27;t hunting clues or sneaking around during the game&#x27;s quieter moments, he&#x27;ll have a delightful arsenal on hand. This includes wacky ones like a turpentine gun that melts the inked &quot;skin&quot; of your foes. Fun stuff.

Like
Cuphead
,
Mouse
&#x27;s most obvious point of comparison, it uses hand-drawn frames to recreate that old-school style. It also deploys an original jazz soundtrack recorded by an orchestral ensemble. It&#x27;s all presented in a gritty, film noir aesthetic.
You can check out the release date trailer below.
Mouse: P.I. for Hire
will launch next March on PC, Switch 2, Switch, PS5/4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.

                <div class="summary">Rivian’s founder and CEO RJ Scaringe is taking on a new role at his company as part of a restructuring ahead of next year’s launch of the R2 SUV, which involves a
layoff of more than 600 employees
. Scaringe told employees in an email on Thursday that he will be acting as Rivian’s chief marketing officer on an interim basis as the company searches for someone to fill that position for the first time. The head of Rivian’s “marketing experiences” team and the lead of the company’s creative studio will now report directly to Scaringe, according to a copy of the email obtained by TechCrunch. It’s not clear how many direct reports Scaringe already has — a spokesperson declined to comment — though he told the Decoder podcast last year that it was a “large number.”
“I am writing to share a difficult update,” Scaringe said in the email to Rivian’s staff. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams. These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”
Scaringe said the “changing operating backdrop” — a nod to the loss of the federal EV tax credit, increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and general headwinds against clean energy projects in the U.S. — forced the company to “rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”
In addition to Scaringe taking point on Rivian’s marketing and creative divisions, the company is also “streamlining” the customer experience, according to the email. Scaringe said Rivian is moving its “vehicle operations” team and integrating it with the company’s service division. Meanwhile, Rivian’s delivery and “mobile operations” will now live inside the sales division. These structural changes are being made to “ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery,” he wrote.</div>

Carl Franzen
October 23, 2025

Microsoft today held a
live announcement event online
for its Copilot AI digital assistant, with
Mustafa Suleyman
, CEO of Microsoft&#x27;s AI division, and other presenters unveiling a new generation of features that deepen integration across Windows, Edge, and Microsoft 365, positioning the platform as a practical assistant for people during work and off-time, while allowing them  to preserve control and safety of their data. The new
Copilot 2025 Fall Update features
also up the ante in terms of capabilities and the accessibility of generative AI assistance from Microsoft to users, so businesses relying on Microsoft products, and those who seek to offer complimentary or competing products, would do well to review them. Suleyman emphasized that the updates reflect a shift from hype to usefulness. “Technology should work in service of people, not the other way around,” he said. “Copilot is not just a product—it’s a promise that AI can be helpful, supportive, and deeply personal.”
Intriguingly, the announcement also sought to shine a greater spotlight on Microsoft&#x27;s own homegrown AI models, as opposed to those of its partner and investment OpenAI, which previously powered the entire Copilot experience. Instead, Suleyman wrote today in a
blog post:
“At the foundation of it all is our strategy to put the best models to work for you – both those we build and those we don’t. Over the past few months, we have released in-house models like MAI-Voice-1, MAI-1-Preview and MAI-Vision-1, and are rapidly iterating.”
12 Features That Redefine Copilot
The Fall Release consolidates Copilot’s identity around twelve key capabilities—each with potential to streamline organizational knowledge work, development, or support operations.</div>

Microsoft said earlier this month that it
wanted to add better voice controls to Copilot
, Windows 11’s built-in chatbot-slash-virtual assistant. As described, this new version of Copilot sounds an awful lot like another stab at Cortana, the voice assistant that Microsoft tried (and failed) to get people to use in Windows 10 in the mid-to-late 2010s. Turns out that the company isn’t done trying to reformulate and revive ideas it has already tried before. As part of a push toward what it calls “human-centered AI,” Microsoft is now
putting a face on Copilot
. Literally, a face: “Mico” is an “expressive, customizable, and warm” blob with a face that dynamically “listens, reacts, and even changes colors to reflect your interactions” as you interact with Copilot. (Another important adjective for Mico: “optional.”)
Mico (rhymes with “pico”) recalls old digital assistants like Clippy, Microsoft Bob, and
Rover
, ideas that Microsoft tried in the ’90s and early 2000s before mostly abandoning them. Microsoft clearly thinks that backing these ideas with language and/or reasoning models will help Copilot succeed where both Cortana and Clippy failed.</div>

Atlas Lion used phishing to infiltrate gift card systems and impersonate authorized employees
Attackers mapped infrastructure, avoided malware, and exploited internal workflows to steal gift cards
Gift cards are fast, untraceable, and easily resold; access lasted nearly a year
A Moroccan hacking collective has been targeting companies issuing gift cards for years, infiltrating their systems, stealing the cards, and likely reselling them on the black market for profit, new research has claimed. Researchers at Unit 42 from Palo Alto Networks dubbed the campaign “Jingle Thief”, since it’s most active during the festive season. As per the report, the group tracked as “Atlas Lion”, or “Storm-0539”, would first carefully pick its target, and try to learn as much about it as possible, before reaching out to its employees with convincing phishing lures. These lures would help them gain initial access, which they would then use to map out the IT infrastructure, with a specific focus on SharePoint and OneDrive. You may like
