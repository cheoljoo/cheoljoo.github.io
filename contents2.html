AI is too risky to insure, say people whose job is insuring risk
What happens when the software that everyone’s racing to adopt becomes too risky for anyone to insure? According to
reporting from the Financial Times
, we’re about to find out.
Major insurers including AIG, Great American, and WR Berkley are asking U.S. regulators for permission to exclude AI-related liabilities from corporate policies. One underwriter describes the AI models’ outputs to the FT as “too much of a black box.”
The industry has good reason to be spooked, the story reminds us. Google’s AI Overview falsely accused a solar company of legal troubles, triggering a
$110 million
lawsuit back in March. Air Canada last year got stuck honoring a discount its
chatbot invented
. And fraudsters last year used a digitally cloned version of a senior executive to steal
$25 million
from the London-based design engineering firm Arup during a video call that seemed entirely real.
What really terrifies insurers isn’t one massive payout; it’s the systemic risk of thousands of simultaneous claims when a widely used AI model steps in it. As one Aon executive put it, insurers can handle a $400 million loss to one company. What they can’t handle is an agentic AI mishap that triggers 10,000 losses at once.

Lean4: How the theorem prover works and why it&#x27;s the new competitive edge in AI
Dhyey Mavani
November 23, 2025
Large language models (LLMs) have astounded the world with their capabilities, yet they remain plagued by unpredictability and hallucinations – confidently outputting incorrect information. In high-stakes domains like finance, medicine or autonomous systems, such unreliability is unacceptable.
Enter
Lean4
, an open-source programming language and interactive theorem prover becoming a key tool to inject rigor and certainty into AI systems. By leveraging formal verification, Lean4 promises to make AI safer, more secure and deterministic in its functionality. Let&#x27;s explore how Lean4 is being adopted by AI leaders and why it could become foundational for building trustworthy AI.
What is Lean4 and why it matters
Lean4 is both a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formal verification. Every theorem or program written in Lean4 must pass a strict type-checking by Lean’s trusted kernel, yielding a binary verdict: A statement either checks out as correct or it doesn’t. This all-or-nothing verification means there’s no room for ambiguity – a property or result is proven true or it fails. Such rigorous checking “
dramatically increases the reliability
” of anything formalized in Lean4. In other words, Lean4
provides a framework
where correctness is mathematically guaranteed, not just hoped for.
This level of certainty is precisely what today’s AI systems lack. Modern AI outputs are generated by complex neural networks with probabilistic behavior. Ask the same question twice and you might get different answers. By contrast, a Lean4 proof or program will behave deterministically – given the same input, it produces the same verified result every time. This determinism and transparency (every inference step can be audited) make Lean4 an appealing antidote to AI’s unpredictability.</div>

Automotive lighting tech. It’s not something most people think about, but just like touchscreens, infotainment systems, cameras, and
ADAS
(Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), lighting tech has evolved by leaps and bounds over the last few years, and has become an integral part of the modern vehicle experience – especially in EVs, where power efficiency is critical to getting the most range out of the battery pack.
From exterior dot-matrix displays and pixel grilles, to matrix headlights, to
OLED
taillights, to customizable ambient lighting, the latest lighting tech is increasing safety while also enabling new ways for drivers to personalize their vehicles. Because, let’s face it, some of this new lighting tech is bedazzling EVs and combustion vehicles alike. So, what’s new in this domain? Why should you care? Let’s dive in and find out.

In case you haven’t noticed, retro-chic is fashionable these days, and pixelated design motifs are in right now. Just check out the headlights and taillights on Hyundai’s EVs – like the
IONIQ 5
and
IONIQ 9
I drove this year – or the Glyph Matrix on the back of
Nothing’s Phone 3
. Then there’s the grille on Mercedes’
new GLC EV,
which features an optional array of 942 white “pixels” and basically doubles as a pixelated dot-matrix display.</div>

Nintendo has made some of the most iconic video games of all time, but building a library of the standouts can quickly become expensive, especially given that many titles don’t often go on sale at a significant discount. The good news is that Nintendo is already running a holiday sale in the run-up to Black Friday, allowing you to save on Nintendo Switch games, amiibo, and accessories through November 28th.</div>

reMarkable makes some of our favorite E Ink tablets, and the company is running a
Black Friday promotion
that discounts bundles by up to $70. The bundles come with the tablet of your choosing, plus a folio case and a Marker stylus.
Both the reMarkable 2 and the reMarkable Paper Pro are on our list of the
best E ink tablets
. The reMarkable 2 in particular offers a great reading and writing experience, with support for Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox. It&#x27;s easy to use and the screen looks great.

This includes a Folio case and the Marker stylus.

The battery lasts around two weeks, which is one of the benefits of this type of display. It supports Wi-Fi and can integrate both PDFs and ePub files. It&#x27;s also easy to create your own notebooks that keep track of handwritten notes. To that end, there are eight brush types here to mark up documents and take notes.

The only major downside of the reMarkable 2 is that it doesn&#x27;t ship with the company&#x27;s newest Marker Plus stylus. However, this sale lessens that concern. A bundle with the tablet, the Marker Plus and the most simple case costs around $458, whereas the tablet by itself typically costs $399.
There&#x27;s a similar discounted bundle available for the Paper Pro tablet. This knocks $50 off the asking price.
