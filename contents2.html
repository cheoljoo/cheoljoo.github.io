OpenAI’s ‘embarrassing’ math
“Hoisted by their own GPTards.”
That’s how Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun
described
the blowback after OpenAI researchers did a victory lap over GPT-5’s supposed math breakthroughs.
Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis
added
, “this is embarrassing.”
The Decoder
reports
that in a since-deleted tweet, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil declared that “GPT-5 found solutions to 10 (!) previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 others.” (“Erdős problems” are
famous conjectures
posed by mathematician Paul Erdős.)
However, mathematician Thomas Bloom, who maintains
the Erdos Problems website
, said Weil’s post was
“a dramatic misrepresentation”
— while these problems were indeed listed as “open” on Bloom’s website, he said that only means, “I personally am unaware of a paper which solves it.”
In other words, it’s not accurate to claim GPT-5 was able to solve previously unsolved problems. Instead, Bloom wrote, “GPT-5 found references, which solved these problems, that I personally was unaware of.”
Sebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher who’d also been touting GPT-5’s accomplishments, then
acknowledged
that “only solutions in the literature were found,” but he suggested this remains a real accomplishment: “I know how hard it is to search the literature.”

The teacher is the new engineer: Inside the rise of AI enablement and PromptOps

As more companies quickly begin using gen AI, it’s important to avoid a big mistake that could impact its effectiveness: Proper onboarding. Companies spend time and money training new human workers to succeed, but when they use large language model (LLM) helpers, many treat them like simple tools that need no explanation.
This isn&#x27;t just a waste of resources; it&#x27;s risky. Research shows that AI has advanced quickly from testing to actual use in 2024 to 2025, with
almost a third of companies
reporting a sharp increase in usage and acceptance from the previous year.
Probabilistic systems need governance, not wishful thinking
Unlike traditional software, gen AI is
probabilistic and adaptive
. It learns from interaction, can drift as data or usage changes and operates in the gray zone between automation and agency. Treating it like static software ignores reality: Without monitoring and updates, models degrade and produce faulty outputs: A phenomenon widely known as
model drift
. Gen AI also lacks built-in
organizational intelligence. A model trained on internet data may write a Shakespearean sonnet, but it won’t know your escalation paths and compliance constraints unless you teach it. Regulators and standards bodies have begun pushing guidance precisely because these systems behave dynamically and can
hallucinate, mislead or leak data
if left unchecked.
The real-world costs of skipping onboarding
When LLMs hallucinate, misinterpret tone, leak sensitive information or amplify bias, the costs are tangible.
Misinformation and liability:
A Canadian tribunal
held Air Canada liable after
its website chatbot gave a passenger incorrect policy information. The ruling made it clear that companies remain responsible for their AI agents’ statements.</div>

The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed Sunday that it is investigating an airliner that was struck by an object in its windscreen, mid-flight, over Utah.
“NTSB gathering radar, weather, flight recorder data,” the federal agency said on the
social media site X
. “Windscreen being sent to NTSB laboratories for examination.”
The strike occurred Thursday, during a United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles.
Images shared on social media
showed that one of the two large windows at the front of a 737 MAX aircraft was significantly cracked. Related images also reveal a pilot’s arm that has been cut multiple times by what appear to be small shards of glass.
Object’s origin not confirmed
The captain of the flight
reportedly
described the object that hit the plane as “space debris.” This has not been confirmed, however.

After the impact, the aircraft safely landed at Salt Lake City International Airport after being diverted.
Images of the strike showed that an object made a forceful impact near the upper right part of the window, showing damage to the metal frame. Because aircraft windows are multiple layers thick, with laminate in between, the window pane did not shatter completely. The aircraft was flying above 30,000 feet—likely around 36,000 feet—and the cockpit apparently maintained its cabin pressure.
So was it space debris? It is impossible to know without more data. A very few species of birds can fly above 30,000 feet.</div>

Oracle claims its Zettascale10 system can hit 16 zettaFLOPS peak
The project uses around 800,000 Nvidia GPUs spread across data centers
OpenAI’s Stargate cluster in Texas runs on Oracle’s new infrastructure
Oracle has announced what it calls the largest AI supercomputer in the cloud, the OCI
Zettascale10
.
The company claims the system can deliver 16 zettaFLOPS of peak performance across 800,000
Nvidia
GPUs.
That output, when divided, equals about 20 petaflops per GPU, roughly matching the Grace Blackwell GB300 Ultra chip used in high-end desktop AI systems.

Network design for large-scale AI workloads
Oracle says the platform is the foundation for OpenAI’s Stargate cluster in Abilene, Texas, built to handle some of the most demanding AI workloads now emerging in research and commercial use.
“The highly scalable custom RoCE design maximizes fabric-wide performance at gigawatt scale while keeping most of the power focused on compute…,” said Peter Hoeschele, vice president, Infrastructure and Industrial Compute, OpenAI.
At the core of the Zettascale10 system is Oracle Acceleron RoCE networking, designed to increase scalability and reliability for data-heavy AI operations.</div>

I’ve read
a lot
of horror books over the last two years. But my absolute favorite is easily Mariana Enriquez’
Our Share of Night
. The book was originally published in 2019 in Argentina, but it only got an English translation in 2023. While it doesn’t quite reach Stephen King lengths, at nearly 600 pages, I’d say it still counts as an epic.
There are certainly scary and gruesome moments in the story involving ancient gods, a powerful cult, and brutal ritual violence. But as is usually the case with the best horror, the supernatural here is a stand-in for real-world terrors.</div>

As
political tensions
between the two global superpowers grow, China&#x27;s State Security Ministry accused the US&#x27; National Security Agency of a cyberattack operation that took place between 2023 and 2024. As first reported by
Reuters
, the Chinese agency posted on WeChat that the NSA targeted the country&#x27;s National Time Service Center. As part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the center is tasked with generating, maintaining and transmitting its national standard of time, which is provided to important sectors across the country, including communications, defense and finance.
The state ministry said the operation used around 42 types of &quot;special cyberattack weapons&quot; to infiltrate the National Time Service Center which could have led to the disruption of network communications, financial systems and power supply. The WeChat post also claimed that the NSA exploited vulnerabilities in a foreign mobile phone brand&#x27;s messaging system to steal sensitive info from staff devices, without naming the brand.
The NSA has yet to respond to the accusation. On the other hand, the US Treasury Department said it was targeted by a &quot;China state-sponsored actor&quot; in a
December cyberattack

                <div class="summary">Wikipedia is often described as
the last good website
on an internet increasingly filled with toxic social media and AI slop. But it seems the online encyclopedia is not completely immune to broader trends, with human pageviews falling 8% year-over-year, according to
a new blog post
from Marshall Miller of the Wikimedia Foundation.
The foundation works to distinguish between traffic from humans and bots, and Miller writes that the decline “over the past few months” was revealed after an update to Wikipedia’s bot detection systems appeared to show that “much of the unusually high traffic for the period of May and June was coming from bots that were built to evade detection.”
Why is traffic falling? Miller points to “the impact of generative AI and social media on how people seek information,” particularly as “search engines are increasingly using generative AI to provide answers directly to searchers rather than linking to sites like ours” and as “younger generations are seeking information on social video platforms rather than the open web.” (Google has
disputed the claim
that AI summaries reduce traffic from search.)
Miller says the foundation welcomes “new ways for people to gain knowledge” and argues this doesn’t make Wikipedia any less important, since knowledge sourced from the encyclopedia is still reaching people even if they don’t visit the website. Wikipedia even experimented with AI summaries of its own, though it
paused the effort after editors complained
.
But this shift does present risks, particularly if people are becoming less aware of where their information actually comes from. As Miller puts it, “With fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.” (Some of those volunteers are truly remarkable,
reportedly disarming a gunman at a Wikipedia editors’ conference
on Friday.</div>

Google is adding a new feature for third-party developers building atop its Gemini AI models that rivals like OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, and the growing array of Chinese open source options are unlikely to get anytime soon:
grounding with Google Maps.
This addition allows developers to connect Google&#x27;s Gemini AI models&#x27; reasoning capabilities with live geospatial data from Google Maps, enabling applications to deliver detailed, location-relevant responses to user queries—such as business hours, reviews, or the atmosphere of a specific venue.
By tapping into data from over 250 million places, developers can now build more intelligent and responsive location-aware experiences.
This is particularly useful for applications where proximity, real-time availability, or location-specific personalization matter—such as local search, delivery services, real estate, and travel planning.
When the user’s location is known, developers can pass latitude and longitude into the request to enhance the response quality.
By tightly integrating real-time and historical Maps data into the Gemini API, Google enables applications to generate grounded, location-specific responses with factual accuracy and contextual depth that are uniquely possible through its mapping infrastructure.
Merging AI and Geospatial Intelligence
The new feature is accessible in Google AI Studio, where developers can try a live demo powered by the Gemini Live API. Models that support the grounding with Google Maps include:
Gemini 2.5 Pro
Gemini 2.5 Flash
Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
Gemini 2.0 Flash
In one
demonstration
, a user asked for Italian restaurant recommendations in Chicago.
The assistant, leveraging Maps data, retrieved top-rated options and clarified a misspelled restaurant name before locating the correct venue with accurate business details.</div>

We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, from modern to ancient and all points in between. With that in mind, we’ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a
curated list of some of our favorites from GOG’s catalog
. At the end of every month, we’ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.
Twice a month, we’ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we’ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you’ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out
the earlier pieces in the series

Even in my youth, I always loved the idea of point-and-click adventure games more than I did the reality. I appreciated how they transported me to other worlds, each with its own rules, histories, and interesting characters. However, like many people, I often ran up against the harsh reality of solving bizarre and obtuse puzzles in a time before Internet walkthroughs.
I almost never actually finished point-and-click adventure games for that reason—but there is one major exception: I completed Roberta Williams’
The Colonel’s Bequest
several times.
One of the last Sierra adventure games to still use a text parser,
The Colonel’s Bequest
follows a young woman named Laura Bow as she visits a mansion in the Southern US belonging to her college friend’s grandfather, Colonel Henri Dijon.</div>

Here’s how it works

Picture this: I’m soaring 35,000 feet above the ground, flying through the clouds – and I’ve got the digital world at my fingertips as if I were on the ground. I’m streaming the latest Conan bit on
YouTube
on my iPad, jumping into a
Fortnite
match on my iPhone, listening to Spotify in the background, and even knocking out some work on my laptop.
Sounds impossible, right? After all, in-flight Wi-Fi is notorious for being slow, spotty, and unpredictable – varying from airline to airline, and even from plane to plane. But
United Airlines
is trying to change that. Thanks to its partnership with Starlink for its next-generation Wi-Fi product, it’s rolling out much faster Wi-Fi at no cost across its entire fleet.
The process started back in May 2025, when United began installing new antennas and Wi-Fi access points on its regional jets – dubbed
United Express.
About 170 of those planes are already equipped.

But this week marked a big milestone: United debuted Starlink on its first mainline jet, a Boeing 737-800. I got to experience it firsthand on a test flight on October 14, 2025. The flight departed from and returned to Chicago’s O’Hare Airport – and the next day, that same jet entered regular service for passengers.
To put it simply, the connection was fantastic – on par with my home internet and, at times, even faster.</div>
