                <div class="summary">Earlier this year, Anker, the Chinese company that makes Eufy security cameras, offered its users money in exchange for videos of packages and car thefts.
The popular internet-connected security camera maker
said it would pay its customers $2 per video to train its AI systems
to help better detect thieves who steal cars and packages.
“To ensure we have enough data, we are looking for videos of both real and staged events, to help train the Al what to be on the lookout for,” the company wrote on its website.
“You can even create events by pretending to be a thief and donate those events,” the website reads. “You can complete this quickly. Maybe one act can be captured by your two outdoor cameras simultaneously, making it efficient and easy. If you also stage a car door theft, you might earn $80.”
Eufy also wrote that “the data collected from these staged events is used solely for training our Al algorithms and not for any other purposes.”
This initiative shows that companies are willing to pay to get users’ data they think can be useful to train their AI models. While this gives some users the ability to get value out of their own data, there are security and privacy risks involved.
Case in point: Last week, TechCrunch found that Neon,
a viral calling app
that offered money to users willing to share recordings and transcripts of their calls,
had a security flaw that allowed users to access any other user’s data
. After being alerted of the security lapse, Neon went offline.
Hundreds of thousands of videos ‘donated’ to train AI
Eufy’s campaign offering $2 per video for theft videos ran from December 18, 2024, to February 25, 2025. More than 120 users responded on the campaign’s announcement page saying they participated in it, according to comments posted by users there.
The company’s goal was to collect 20,000 videos each of package thefts and of “pulling car doors.</div>

On Tuesday, OpenAI
announced
Sora 2, its second-generation video-synthesis AI model that can now generate videos in various styles with synchronized dialogue and sound effects, which is a first for the company. OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls &quot;cameos.&quot;
OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden.
Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls &quot;sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.&quot; In May, Google&#x27;s
Veo 3
became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released
Wan 2.5
, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.
OpenAI demonstrates Sora 2&#x27;s capabilities in a launch video.
The model also features notable visual consistency improvements over OpenAI&#x27;s previous video model, and it can also follow more complex instructions across multiple shots while maintaining coherency between them.</div>

Euclyd CRAFTWERK SiP claims bandwidth levels far beyond Nvidia’s designs
The rack-scale system is said to reach over one exaflop performance
Power efficiency claims suggest massive gains, though independent testing is missing
European startup Euclyd has announced new hardware aimed at large-scale AI inference.
The system, called CRAFTWERK, was introduced at the KISACO Infrastructure Summit 2025 in Santa Clara.
The
company
describes it as designed specifically for agentic AI workloads, with specifications that set it apart from current accelerators.

Acer joins Nvidia GB10 superchip fan club with $3,999 Veriton AI mini workstation PC - and yes, you can link two to get even more power
&#x27;Enfabrica has the coolest technology&#x27;: Nvidia spent nearly $1 billion on a chip maker to secure its future on the same day it gave Intel $5 billion - and here&#x27;s why this is actually a more important investment
Inside the CRAFTWERK architecture
At the core of the release is the CRAFTWERK SiP, a system-in-package that fits into the palm of a hand.
It integrates 16,384 custom SIMD
processors
alongside 1TB of custom ultra-bandwidth memory, or UBM.
Euclyd claims this memory can deliver 8,000 terabytes per second of bandwidth.
The compute performance is listed at up to 8 petaflops in FP16 and 32 petaflops in FP4 precision.</div>

President Donald Trump is launching a new government-run website that he says will let Americans buy medications at lower prices. The new website, called TrumpRx, is expected to launch in 2026 and will direct consumers to discounts on drugmakers’ online stores, including Pfizer’s, as reported earlier
by
The New York Times
and
NPR
.
The Tuesday announcement comes as part of a deal that grants Pfizer a three-year reprieve from tariffs in exchange for investing in US-based manufacturing, according to the
company’s press release
. Pfizer also agreed to lower prices on the “majority” of the primary care drugs sold through state Medicaid programs, which it says could result in an average savings of 50 percent.

Ubisoft has launched — and named — its Tencent-backed subsidiary. Vantage Studios is the first of the company&#x27;s &quot;creative houses&quot; under a previously-announced reorganization. The new studio will oversee the company&#x27;s tentpole franchises: Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six.
The news follows Ubisoft&#x27;s
March announcement of a new subsidiary
with a €1.16 billion ($1.36 billion) investment from Tencent. The Chinese company took a minority ownership stake in Vantage as part of the deal. In July, Ubisoft
named
the new subsidiary&#x27;s co-CEOs: Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot.
&quot;Our focus is on evolving Ubisoft&#x27;s operating model to bring more focus, more autonomy and more accountability to the teams so they can stay closely attuned to our players,&quot; Guillemot said at the time. &quot;Decision making will be quicker, and it will also be easier to pivot when we need to change course.&quot;
Ubisoft
Ubisoft&#x27;s
announcement
today reflected that language. The idea is to give its developers &quot;a higher level of autonomy&quot; at Vantage and future studios. It wants the new structure to enable &quot;a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback.&quot;

Vantage is the only creative house the parent company has announced. The company will set up future ones &quot;under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise.&quot; However, it&#x27;s unclear what other creative houses will work on, with Vantage taking over Ubisoft&#x27;s bread-and-butter franchises.
Vantage&#x27;s team will be spread across Ubisoft&#x27;s offices in Montréal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona and Sofia. Multiple gaming publications, including

                <div class="summary">The Department of Energy said Wednesday night it was canceling 321 awards worth $7.56 billion that were largely focused on clean energy.
The agency hasn’t publicly released a list of the affected projects and, at the time of publication, it had not provided one to TechCrunch. According to E&amp;E News and Heatmap, which have obtained the list, the majority of the cuts have hit states that went for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, though some were in “red” states that voted for President Trump.
Direct air capture and hydrogen hub projects appear to have been wiped out as a result. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that one of the canceled projects included $1.2 billion for the state’s hydrogen hub, the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, and E&amp;E News is
reporting
that hubs in Texas and Louisiana were also on the chopping block.
At least 10 direct air capture (DAC) projects totaling $47.3 million were cut, though those in Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and North Dakota have survived. The oil and gas industry has been supportive of DAC projects because the captured CO
2
can be injected into underperforming oil wells to boost production.
Other states affected by the billions in canceled contracts include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.
The Harris-voting states with canceled projects were confirmed in a
tweet
from Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. He teased the cancellations earlier yesterday in an apparent effort to deepen partisanship during the shutdown, adding that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled.”
All 16 states that he listed voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, and many are controlled by Democrats at the state level. Conspicuously, Vought omitted Trump-voting states that were on the list.

On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had
offered nine schools a deal
: manage your universities in a way that aligns with administration priorities and get “substantial and meaningful federal grants,&quot; along with other benefits. Failure to accept the bargain would result in a withdrawal of federal programs that would likely cripple most universities. The offer, sent to a mixture of state and private universities, would see the government dictate everything from hiring and admissions standards to grading and has provisions that appear intended to make conservative ideas more welcome on campus.
The document was sent to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Virginia. However, independent reporting indicates that the administration will ultimately extend the deal to all colleges and universities.
Ars has obtained a copy of the proposed &quot;Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,&quot; which makes the scope of the bargain clear in its introduction. &quot;Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,&quot; it suggests, while mentioning that...</div>

You don&#x27;t need to be a barista to get an espresso at home. Nespresso machines can give you just that, like this discounted
Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus at Amazon for just $99 (was $129.95)
.
The Nespresso Vertuo Pop machine is our pick for the
best beginner-friendly Nespresso coffee maker
and is still one of our all-time favorite kitchen appliances. It&#x27;s also one of Nespresso&#x27;s most colorful products, including vibrant colors like Spicy Red and Aqua Mint that are available in this deal on
Amazon
.
What also makes this Nespresso such a good option is that it offers espresso and latte settings that
Keurig machines
typically don&#x27;t have. The Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus, which is one of the cheapest Nespresso machines on the market, has several settings you can choose between to get the exact type of coffee you&#x27;d like.
Today&#x27;s best Nespresso deal
Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus:
was $129.95
now $99
at Amazon
We crowned the Nespresso Vertuo Pop our best beginner-friendly coffee and espresso machine and rated it five out of five stars in our review, so I definitely think it&#x27;s worth bagging while it&#x27;s under $100. This Vertuo Pop Plus comes with an even larger tank, so you don&#x27;t need to refill water as often, while its plug-and-play setup means all you need to do is connect it to an electrical outlet, place a compatible Nespresso pod in the dispenser, and then toss it when it&#x27;s finished brewing. This user-friendly machine can brew five different cup sizes depending on the pods you buy.

The Vertuo Pop Plus is basically the same thing as the Vertuo Pop, just with a few differences, including automatic opening and a larger wa...</div>

Ring’s new Search Party feature is on by default; should you opt out?
﻿Search Party goes through footage from nearby Ring outdoor cameras when a dog goes missing. Admirable. But maybe ask me first.

Crashout Crew
(Aggro Crab)
It&#x27;s been quite the year for Aggro Crab. After stopping production on a sequel to
Going Under
(with funding issues and burnout both
factoring into that decision
), the studio decided to focus on self-funded game jam projects before moving onto another big game. Some of the team collaborated with
Content Warning
developer Landfall to create
Peak
.
With the help of
clever marketing
, that co-op climbing game turned out to be a huge hit, selling 10 million copies in just two months.
The rest of the Aggro Crab squad focused on a different multiplayer game, which is called
Crashout Crew
. This is a party game for up to four players (there&#x27;s a single-player option too) in which you&#x27;ll try to complete orders in hazard-filled warehouses using cute, color-coded forklifts. Time is of the essence as you race to meet quotas by loading boxes into trucks, so it’s just as well that you can drift around corners. Just be careful not to drop any explosives.
You’ll be skidding around icy environments and spinning out if you run over a broken egg. Falling rocks, bees and blackouts all add to the chaos. You can upgrade your forklift and warehouse, though they’ll reset after the level ends.
The reveal trailer reminds me quite a bit of
Overcooked
. I wonder if this could turn out to be just as effective as a litmus test for how well you communicate with family and friends.
I adore
Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure
, Aggro Crab’s last large-scale game, so I&#x27;ll always be interested in whatever the studio is cooking up. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out
Crashout Crew
when the demo goes live on October 13 as part of Steam Next Fest. The game is scheduled to hit Steam next year.
