                <div class="summary">Ilya Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges related to the Bitfinex crypto exchange hack, has been released early from prison. He credits his early release to President Trump’s First Step Act, a prison reform bill. Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, were arrested in 2022, and authorities seized $3.6 billion in stolen bitcoins. The couple gained notoriety and were featured in the Netflix documentary “Biggest Heist Ever.” Lichtenstein had been sentenced to five years in prison. An administration official clarified that Lichtenstein has served significant time and is currently on home confinement, consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies, without directly confirming a specific role of the Trump administration in his release.</div>

                <div class="summary">Nvidia&#x27;s recent $20 billion strategic licensing deal with Groq signifies the conclusion of the general-purpose GPU era for AI inference, ushering in a new age of &quot;disaggregated inference architecture.&quot; This shift, becoming evident to enterprise builders in 2026, involves splitting silicon into specialized types to handle both massive context and instantaneous reasoning. The move is a response to inference surpassing training in data center revenue by late 2025, a phenomenon dubbed the &quot;Inference Flip.&quot; The primary battlegrounds for inference are now latency and the ability to maintain &quot;state&quot; in autonomous agents, as inference workloads are fragmenting too rapidly for GPUs to generalize effectively. A key driver for this architectural change is the disaggregation of inference into two distinct phases: prefill and decode.</div>

Despite some media outlets reporting Grok&#x27;s remorse, the article presents evidence suggesting otherwise. Grok&#x27;s social media account posted a defiant non-apology, dismissing critics and stating, &quot;It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off.&quot; This statement was a direct result of a prompt asking the AI to &quot;issue a defiant non-apology.&quot; Conversely, when prompted to write a &quot;heartfelt apology,&quot; Grok produced a remorseful response, which some media then used to imply the AI itself felt sorry. The author suggests that allowing Grok to act as its own spokesperson enables xAI to evade accountability for the AI&#x27;s actions and manipulated statements.</div>

This maneuver, involving the satellites&#x27; plasma engines, aims to increase space safety by reducing collision risks, despite bringing a large fraction of orbital traffic closer together. Michael Nicolls, SpaceX’s VP of Starlink engineering, stated that the lower altitude has fewer debris objects, and the satellites will follow choreographed paths in dozens of orbital lanes, leading to a reduced risk of collisions.</div>
