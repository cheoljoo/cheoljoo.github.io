                <div class="summary">Nuclear startup Antares secured $96 million in Series B funding ($71 million equity, $25 million debt) to advance its small modular reactor design. The round was led by Shine Capital with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, and Industrious, among others. Antares&#x27; R1 microreactor, which uses TRISO fuel (carbon- and ceramic-coated uranium spheres in graphite), targets commercial, defense, and space applications, producing 100 kilowatts to 1 megawatt of electricity.

This funding reflects a recent surge in interest and investment in nuclear power. Other companies in the sector have also seen significant capital raises: Amazon-backed X-energy recently raised a $700 million Series D round, following a $700 million Series C. Deep Fission went public via a $30 million reverse merger. Aalo Atomics raised $100 million to build a microreactor-powered data center, and Nvidia contributed to a $650 million round for TerraPower, a Bill Gates-backed SMR startup. Even large nuclear plants are experiencing a resurgence.</div>

                <div class="summary">Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced &quot;frontier agents,&quot; a new class of AI systems capable of autonomous work for hours or days without human intervention, aiming to automate the entire software development lifecycle. The announcement was made by AWS CEO Matt Garman at the re:Invent conference on December 2, 2025.

These agents include Kiro for software development, AWS Security Agent for application security, and AWS DevOps Agent for IT operations. Amazon views these as a significant leap beyond existing AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or CodeWhisperer, which require constant human interaction. Deepak Singh, VP of developer agents and experiences at Amazon, stated that frontier agents are designed for complex, multi-day challenges, allowing them to think, try solutions, and reach conclusions independently. This move highlights Amazon&#x27;s ambition to lead in developing AI systems for intricate, multi-step engineering tasks.</div>

Subscribers have reported numerous errors in the new 4K masters. Issues include incorrect episode titles for some episodes, such as &quot;5G&quot; and &quot;Red in the Face.&quot; More significantly, a glaring error in the &quot;Red in the Face&quot; episode&#x27;s infamous vomiting scene now clearly shows a production crew member. These errors suggest a lack of quality control during the post-production process for the 4K masters. The article was written by Charles Pulliam-Moore and published on December 2, 2025.</div>

                <div class="summary">Fubo subscribers are currently unable to access NBC and other NBCUniversal-owned channels, including USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo, due to a contract dispute between Fubo and NBCUniversal. The blackout began on November 21st, with no projected return date. This means Fubo customers are missing popular programming like the Today Show, The Voice, Sunday Night Football, and upcoming NBA coverage.

Fubo claims NBCUniversal&#x27;s pricing and packaging terms are &quot;egregiously above those offered to other distributors,&quot; while an NBCUniversal spokesperson states Fubo was offered the same terms as hundreds of other distributors and has a history of dropping networks. Fubo previously cut Warner-owned channels in 2024.</div>

                <div class="summary">Tech YouTuber
Marques Brownlee
, or MKBHD, announced on Monday that his phone wallpaper app
Panels
is shutting down.
Fans had high hopes for Brownlee’s foray into app development, given his reputation as an eagle-eyed tech reviewer who has amassed more than 20 million followers on YouTube. He’s so influential that some blamed his commentary on Humane AI and
Fisker
for those companies’ eventual failures (we think the real issue is that you shouldn’t raise
$230 million
if you have no product). Yet from the time Brownlee
launched Panels
in September 2024, the app struggled to find an audience of its own.
“We knew it was niche, but we made mistakes in making our first app, and ultimately, we weren’t able to turn it into the vision I had,” Brownlee said in an
unlisted YouTube video
. In a
blog post
, he added that “the makeup of the development team changed,” and he was unable to find the right collaborators to grow the app.
Brownlee was inspired to create Panels because when he posts video reviews of phones, tablets, and computers, fans always point out how stunning his wallpapers and lock screens are. When he first
announced
the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd…” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.”
Panels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog.
Thanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked #1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum.</div>

DeepSeek just dropped two insanely powerful AI models that rival GPT-5 and they&#x27;re totally free

Chinese artificial intelligence startup
DeepSeek
released two powerful new AI models on Sunday that the company claims match or exceed the capabilities of OpenAI&#x27;s
GPT-5
and Google&#x27;s
Gemini-3.0-Pro
— a development that could reshape the competitive landscape between American tech giants and their Chinese challengers.
The Hangzhou-based company launched
DeepSeek-V3.2
, designed as an everyday reasoning assistant, alongside DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, a high-powered variant that achieved gold-medal performance in four elite international competitions: the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Olympiad in Informatics, the ICPC World Finals, and the China Mathematical Olympiad.
The release carries profound implications for American technology leadership. DeepSeek has once again demonstrated that it can produce frontier AI systems despite U.S. export controls that
restrict China&#x27;s access to advanced Nvidia chips
— and it has done so while making its models freely available under an open-source MIT license.
&quot;People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough but we came back much bigger,&quot; wrote
Chen Fang
, who identified himself as a contributor to the project, on X (formerly Twitter). The release drew swift reactions online, with one user declaring: &quot;
Rest in peace, ChatGPT
.&quot;
How DeepSeek&#x27;s sparse attention breakthrough slashes computing costs
At the heart of the new release lies
DeepSeek Sparse Attention
, or DSA — a novel architectural innovation that dramatically reduces the computational burden of running AI models on long documents and complex tasks.
Traditional AI attention mechanisms, the core technology allowing language models to understand context, scale poorly as input length increases.</div>

It’s been over 10 years since the launch of
the excellent
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
, and nearly four years since
the announcement
of “the next installment in The Witcher series of video games.” Despite those long waits, developer CD Projekt Red is still insisting it will deliver the next three complete
Witcher
games in a short six-year window.
In
a recent earnings call
, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine
in 2022
. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of
widespread technical issues with the console versions of
Cyberpunk 2077
, which CDPR later
blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.”
“We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [
The Witcher 4
] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call.</div>

Cyber Monday is still going strong – in fact, I’ve just spotted a brilliant Cyber Monday deal on one of the best tech products I’ve ever bought.
Amazon is offering the excellent Logitech Ergo K860 ergonomic keyboard for just £59.99 (was £114.99)
, knocking this excellent split keyboard down to just over half price.

I bought the Ergo K860 at full price a few years ago after writing a few too many uni essays on a cramped laptop keyboard and waking up with pains in my shoulders and back, and have loved its comfortable split layout and large wrist pad ever since.
It’s still my go-to for long writing sessions and is holding up well after years of use and thousands of words, making this
Cyber Monday deal
perhaps the easiest shopping recommendation I’ll make all year.
