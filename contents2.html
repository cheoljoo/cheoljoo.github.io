                <div class="summary">Waymo co-CEO Takedra Mawakana believes other companies working on autonomous vehicles need to do more to prove their technology is safe, she said during an interview at
TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
.
Mawakana had just been asked who she considered to be on the list of companies trying to make roads safer during Monday’s interview.
“I don’t know who’s on that list, because they’re not telling us what’s happening with their fleets,” she said.
Prioritizing safety while scaling operations was a big topic during the interview, and Mawakana was sure to cite the
data Waymo recently released
that shows, by its count, that the company’s vehicles are five times safer than human drivers and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians.
Mawakana declined to say whether she was specifically talking about Tesla, but there are only a few companies in the U.S. right now claiming to be working on robotaxi tech.
Tesla
publishes
quarterly “vehicle safety reports.” But that data only focuses on the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance technology, which is designed to be used on highways, where the rate of crashes is lower than on surface streets. (And the
latest report shows an uptick in crashes
.) Tesla has not released any public data about the safety of its nascent robotaxi pilot program in Austin, Texas.
Other companies in the space are early in the deployment phase or still testing their technology. Zoox has only just begun offering rides in its purpose-built AV in Las Vegas, Nevada. Companies like May Mobility and Pony AI have yet to launch commercially in the U.S. Aurora, the self-driving trucks company, has
published a safety framework
.
“I think there is a responsibility, if you’re going to put vehicles on the road, and you’re going to remove the driver from behind the wheel, and you’re going to have someone in some other room observing the fleet who can take over their vehicles, it is incumbent upon you to be transparent about what’s happening,” she said.</div>

Watch out, DeepSeek and Qwen! There&#x27;s a new king of open source large language models (LLMs), especially when it comes to something enterprises are increasingly valuing: agentic tool use — that is, the ability to go off and use other software capabilities like web search or bespoke applications — without much human guidance.
That model is none other than
MiniMax-M2
, the latest LLM from the Chinese startup of the same name. And in a big win for enterprises globally, the model is available under a permissive, enterprise-friendly MIT License, meaning it is made available freely for developers to take, deploy, retrain, and use how they see fit — even for commercial purposes. It can be found on
Hugging Face
,
GitHub
and
ModelScope
, as well as through
MiniMax&#x27;s API here.
It supports OpenAI and Anthropic API standards, as well, making it easy for customers of said proprietary AI startups to shift out their models to MiniMax&#x27;s API, if they want.
According to
independent evaluations by Artificial Analysis
, a third-party generative AI model benchmarking and research organization, M2 now ranks first among all open-weight systems worldwide on the Intelligence Index—a composite measure of reasoning, coding, and task-execution performance.
In agentic benchmarks that measure how well a model can plan, execute, and use external tools—skills that power coding assistants and autonomous agents—MiniMax’s own reported results, following the Artificial Analysis methodology, show τ²-Bench 77.2, BrowseComp 44.0, and FinSearchComp-global 65.5.
These scores place it at or near the level of top proprietary systems like GPT-5 (thinking) and Claude Sonnet 4.</div>

AI-powered search engines rely on “less popular” sources, researchers find

Since last year’s
disastrous rollout of Google’s AI Overviews
, the world at large has been aware of how AI-powered search results can differ wildly from the traditional list of links search engines have generated for decades. Now, new research helps quantify that difference, showing that AI search engines tend to cite less popular websites and ones that wouldn’t even appear in the Top 100 links listed in an “organic” Google search.
In the pre-print paper “
Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI
,” researchers from Ruhr University in Bochum and the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems compared traditional link results from Google’s search engine to its AI Overviews and
Gemini-2.5-Flash
. The researchers also looked at GPT-4o’s web search mode and the separate “GPT-4o with Search Tool,” which resorts to searching the web only when the LLM decides it needs information found outside its own pre-trained data.
The researchers drew test queries from a number of sources, including specific questions submitted to ChatGPT in
the WildChat dataset
, general political topics
listed on AllSides
, and products included in the 100 most-searched Amazon products list.
Overall, the sources cited in results from the generative search tools tended to be from sites that were less popular than those that appeared in the Top 10 of a traditional search, as
measured by the domain-tracker Tranco

Asus ProArt PA32KCX targets professionals seeking uncompromised visual accuracy
8K panel reveals production-level clarity far beyond conventional 4K monitors
The sustained brightness and color depth redefine modern HDR workflows
The ASUS ProArt PA32KCX is the world’s first Mini LED professional
8K monitor
, offering capabilities that go beyond most production displays.
Award-winning filmmaker Brett Danton, among the first to receive one, has been testing it across editing, rendering, and
HDR
workflows.
While his enthusiasm has been clear, the real question is whether the PA32KCX truly offers strong value or simply caters to niche creative pipelines.

Asus just launched another 162-inch 4K Micro LED monitor - yes, a monitor, not a TV, and it&#x27;s almost as big as a wall
World&#x27;s cheapest 5K monitor has gone on preorder for only $570 - KTC H27P3 paves the way for &#x27;affordable&#x27; 10K virtual display
A technical leap that aims for precision
The 32-inch display combines technical features that place it in rare company.
It runs at an
8K
resolution of 7680 x 4320 and maintains an average ΔE value of less than one, which indicates very accurate color reproduction.
The display covers 97% of the DCI-P3 color gamut and delivers up to 1200 nits peak brightness through its 4096-zone Mini LED backlight.</div>

Haven’t you heard?
Phones are boring now
. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.
But even if you’re looking for something a little more
extra
, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can still find a delightful new device.</div>

Cinemark is adding more 70mm IMAX screens ahead of Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey
The format is growing in popularity, and theater chains are trying to accommodate moviegoers.

Matt Damon as Odysseus in The Odyssey
(Universal Pictures)
The movie industry has been in a tailspin for years, with many people foregoing the theatrical experience in favor of watching films at home. I get it. Going to the movies can be expensive and, let’s face it, dealing with other people can be annoying (it’s been 10 years and I’m still mad about those teenagers who would not stop giggling all the way through my first viewing of
The Witch
). But there’s nothing quite like going to a theater and getting lost in a great film for a couple of hours. In addition, large-scale formats are growing in popularity and theater chains are trying to accommodate moviegoers.
Cinemark is installing more IMAX screens, including ones that support 70mm film projection. The company is adding such screens to its locations in Woodridge, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago); Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Rochester, New York. It’s also adding four IMAX with Laser systems — a 4K laser offering — to other locations in the US in the coming months. It’s upgrading its other 12 IMAX screens across the Americas with that tech too.
According to
Variety
, Cinemark plans to have the new IMAX 70mm film screens set up by July 17, 2026. That’s the release date for Christopher Nolan’s next film,
The Odyssey,
which is the first theatrical release to be shot entirely in IMAX. As it stands, only 30 movie theaters on the planet can screen films in IMAX 70mm, which is
Nolan’s preferred format
.

IMAX is proving popular with cinemagoers who are looking for a large-format experience that would be impossible at home (at least not without an obscene private screen).</div>
