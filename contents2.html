                <div class="summary">Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has just announced a satellite internet network called
TeraWave
, which will be capable of offering data speeds up to 6 Tbps, and geared toward enterprise, data center, and government customers. The TeraWave constellation will use a mix of 5,280 satellites in low-Earth orbit and 128 in medium-Earth orbit, and Blue Origin plans to deploy the first ones in late 2027. It’s not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network. The low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6 Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX’s Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps — though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer
1 Gbps data transfer
in the future. “TeraWave adds a space-based layer to your existing network infrastructure, providing connectivity to locations unreachable by traditional methods,” the new website for the satellite network reads. The announcement of the TeraWave network comes just a few months after Bezos’ other company, Amazon, announced a rebrand of its own satellite network geared toward consumers. That network,
called Leo
, will ultimately consist of around 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit and offers more traditional broadband speeds. Taken together, these two networks could provide more robust competition to SpaceX’s Starlink, which has become the leading satellite internet provider with more than 9 million customers. Starlink currently sells its connectivity to regular consumers, commercial customers (like airlines), and governments. That said, the two networks from Amazon and Blue Origin are distinct.

For the modern CFO, the hardest part of the job often isn&#x27;t the math—it&#x27;s the storytelling. After the books are closed and the variances calculated, finance teams spend days, sometimes weeks, manually copy-pasting charts into PowerPoint slides to explain why the numbers moved. Today, 11-year-old Israeli fintech company
Datarails
announced a set of new generative AI tools designed to automate that &quot;last mile&quot; of financial reporting, effectively allowing finance leaders to &quot;vibe code&quot; their way to a board deck. Launching today to accompany the firm&#x27;s newly announced $70 million Series C funding round,
the company’s new Strategy, Planning, and Reporting AI Finance Agents
promise to answer complex financial questions with fully formatted assets, not just text. A finance professional can now ask, &quot;What’s driving our profitability changes this year?&quot; or &quot;Why did Marketing go over budget last month?&quot; and the system will instantly generate board-ready PowerPoint slides, PDF reports, or Excel files containing the answer. The deployment of these agents marks a fundamental shift in how the &quot;Office of the CFO&quot; interacts with data. Beyond the chatbot
The promise of the new agents is to solve the fragmentation problem that plagues finance departments. Unlike a sales leader who lives in Salesforce, or a CIO who relies on ServiceNow, the CFO has no single &quot;system of truth&quot;. Data is scattered across ERPs, HRIS, CRMs, and bank portals. A major barrier to AI adoption in finance has been security. CFOs are rightfully hesitant to plug P&amp;L data into public models. Datarails has addressed this by leveraging Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI...</div>

Researchers at Princeton University have built a swarm of interconnected mini-robots that “bloom” like flowers in response to changing light levels in an office. According to their
new paper
published in the journal Science Robotics, such robotic swarms could one day be used as dynamic facades in architectural designs, enabling buildings to adapt to changing climate conditions as well as interact with humans in creative ways. The authors drew inspiration from so-called “living architectures,” such as beehives. Fire ants provide
a textbook example
of this kind of collective behavior. A few ants spaced well apart behave like individual ants. But pack enough of them closely together, and they behave more like a single unit, exhibiting both solid and liquid properties. You can pour them from a teapot like ants, as Goldman’s lab demonstrated several years ago, or they can link together to build towers or floating rafts—a handy survival skill when, say, a hurricane floods Houston. They
also excel
at regulating their own traffic flow. You almost never see an ant traffic jam. Naturally scientists are keen to mimic such systems. For instance,
in 2018
, Georgia Tech researchers built ant-like robots and programmed them to dig through 3D-printed magnetic plastic balls designed to simulate moist soil. Robot swarms capable of efficiently digging underground without jamming would be super beneficial for mining or disast...</div>

Roku streaming sticks don&#x27;t come with an HDMI cable in their box
... but you can still get one for free if you ask
The request process is simple and should only take a few minutes
If you’ve tried a few different streaming stick brands, you’ll have noticed that
Roku
sticks lack a bonus HDMI cable that you’d get for free with an
Amazon
Fire Stick. Well, it turns out you can get this cable for free with Roku sticks too – if you know where to ask. Whether you’re upgrading an older TV, want access to your favorite streamed content when you travel, or have some other need for one, streaming sticks from the likes of Amazon and Roku can be super handy. But based on the design and port layout of your TV, and the other devices you have connected, it can be tricky to plug a streaming stick directly into your display – which is why Amazon Fire Sticks and others can come with an HDMI extender, a short additionable cable that creates more space between your stick and screen.

Bloomberg
reporter Mark Gurman. The update is reportedly coming later this year and will replace the existing Siri interface, allowing users to interact with the assistant by both typing and talking, similar to the chatbots available from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. As noted by
Bloomberg
, this change is separate from the AI-powered personalization features coming to Siri in the next few months.</div>

Microsoft ports the Xbox app to Arm-based Windows PCs
The company is continuing to expand support for Windows on Arm devices. Ian Carlos Campbell

Microsoft
has announced
that the Xbox app is now available on all Arm-based Windows 11 PCs. The app&#x27;s release follows
an update
Microsoft made to its Prism emulator in December 2025, which translates x86 and x64 apps to Arm, and now includes support for AVX and AVX2. Both extensions play a role in making games run efficiently on Windows. Windows on Arm users will be able to use the Xbox app to purchase, download and stream PC games, and Microsoft says that &quot;more than 85 percent of the Game Pass catalog&quot; now runs on Arm PCs. Unlike Valve&#x27;s SteamOS, Windows on Arm also supports anti-cheat software like Epic&#x27;s Easy Anti Cheat, which means you can access a wider library of online multiplayer games in comparison to what you can get on the Steam Deck. Microsoft has been working on getting Windows running on Arm for years at this point, and the company made a major push with its own
Arm-based hardware
and the launch of the
Copilot+ PC program
in 2024. Many Copilot+ PCs use Qualcomm&#x27;s Snapdragon chips, the latest of which the company
announced in September 2025
. Up until this point Microsoft&#x27;s handheld efforts have been focused on
PCs running AMD chips
, but expanded support for Arm and
Qualcomm&#x27;s own teases
certainly makes it seem like an Arm-based Windows 11 handheld could be announced sooner rather than later. Advertisement
