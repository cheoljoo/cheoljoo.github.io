                <div class="summary">In 2025, data centers transitioned from being an invisible internet backbone to a focal point of public concern, inspiring protests across dozens of U.S. states. Activist groups, numbering 142 across 24 states, are organizing against new data center developments due to environmental and potential health impacts, controversial AI usage, and rising local electricity bills. This populist uprising is a response to the industry&#x27;s rapid growth, with construction spending skyrocketing 331% since 2021, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. Major tech giants like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon plan significant capital expenditures for new AI infrastructure, indicating no slowdown in this buildout, despite expert beliefs that many proposed centers may not be built.</div>

This admission validates what security practitioners have known, highlighting a significant gap between AI deployment and enterprise readiness. A VentureBeat survey revealed that only 34.7% of organizations have dedicated prompt injection defenses. OpenAI&#x27;s defensive architecture, including an LLM-based automated attacker, represents the current peak of what&#x27;s possible, but most commercial enterprises cannot replicate it, making OpenAI&#x27;s shared advances crucial for security leaders protecting AI applications.</div>

                <div class="summary">A study published in the Academy of Management Journal reveals that professional Santas often view their role as a year-round calling, maintaining aspects of the identity beyond the holiday season. Researchers, including Christina Hymer, analyzed surveys from 849 professional Santas and conducted over 50 personal interviews. They identified three categories of professional Santas: prototypical (straight, portly white men with natural white beards), semi-prototypical (fitting some but not all traditional physical characteristics), and those who don&#x27;t fit the stereotypical image. The study explores the motivations and experiences of individuals who choose this line of work.</div>

The advisory focuses on specific time-x-b.nist.gov addresses and the authenticated ntp-b.nist.gov service. To prevent the spread of incorrect data, NIST may temporarily take affected hosts offline.
