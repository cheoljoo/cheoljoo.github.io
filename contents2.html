TechCrunch Mobility
! The year in transportation started with a couple of bankruptcies —
Canoo
and
Nikola
— and now it’s ending with two more. Rad Power Bikes
is coming to an end — or at least a bankruptcy. The electric bike company filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days. And then there is troubled lidar maker
Luminar
, which also
filed for bankruptcy
this week. The Luminar bankruptcy does not seem like a let’s-help-it-live-another-day type of situation. The Luminar filing, which occurred after months of
layoffs
, executive departures, and a
legal fight
with its largest customer, Volvo, notes the company plans to sell off the business. It has already reached a deal to sell its semiconductor subsidiary. While the company will continue to operate during the bankruptcy process to “minimize disruptions” for its suppliers and customers, Luminar will eventually cease to exist once it’s completed, senior reporter
Sean O’Kane
reported. Want to learn more? I recommend reading O’Kane’s piece that looks at how
Luminar’s doomed Volvo deal helped drag the company into bankruptcy
. Even though the year was bookended by some failures, that doesn’t mean 2025 wasn’t filled with innovation and growth. The emerging robotaxi industry has indeed
emerged
. With that I have noticed new kinds of autonomous vehicle-adjacent companies popping up, and I expect that to become a trend in 2026. The scale of robotaxis was largely driven by
Waymo’s
fast-paced growth, although
Zoox
and
Tesla
have also started to set up shop.</div>

Agent autonomy without guardrails is an SRE nightmare

As AI use continues to evolve in large organizations, leaders are increasingly seeking the next development that will yield major ROI. The latest wave of this ongoing trend is the adoption of AI agents. However, as with any new technology, organizations must ensure they adopt AI agents in a responsible way that allows them to facilitate both speed and security. More than half
of organizations have already deployed AI agents to some extent, with more expecting to follow suit in the next two years. But many early adopters are now reevaluating their approach. Four-in-10 tech leaders regret not establishing a
stronger governance foundation
from the start, which suggests they adopted AI rapidly, but with margin to improve on policies, rules and best practices designed to ensure the responsible, ethical and legal development and use of AI. As AI adoption accelerates
, organizations must find the right balance between their exposure risk and the implementation of guardrails to ensure AI use is secure. Where do AI agents create potential risks? There are three principal areas of consideration for safer AI adoption. The first is
shadow AI
, when employees use unauthorized AI tools without express permission, bypassing approved tools and processes. IT should create necessary processes for experimentation and innovation to introduce more efficient ways of working with AI. While shadow AI has existed as long as AI tools themselves, AI agent autonomy makes it easier for unsanctioned tools to operate outside the purview of IT, which can introduce fresh security risks. Secondly, organizations must close gaps in AI ownership and accountability to prepare for incidents or processes gone wrong. The strength of AI agents lies in their autonomy.</div>

Razer Kishi V3 Pro review: Two-minute review
The
Razer
Kishi V3 Pro is a very capable
mobile controller
that comes with reliable and remappable inputs, a comfortable form factor, great software, and a very high price tag. It’s a top choice for those who want a console-style experience on the go thanks to its great analog triggers, full-size thumbsticks, and intuitive design, but doesn’t quite feel as sturdy as a dedicated standalone controller. With that said, the Kishi V3 Pro is reliable enough that it disappears into your hands once you get a game going, either from the home screen or the brilliant Razer Nexus app, which serves as a launcher as well as a home base for settings and calibration. It’s precise enough to give you a real edge in games like
Fortnite
and
Call of Duty
: Mobile
, and also works well in platformers like
Dadish 3D
as well as 2D classics like
Jetpack Joyride

according to Pacific Gas and Electric Company
, but also caused another problem: stranded Waymo vehicles. Posts all over social media showed the company’s autonomous SUVs sitting still in the streets and causing traffic jams.</div>

GuliKit&#x27;s $20 mod makes the ROG Xbox Ally&#x27;s joysticks drift-free
The plug-and-play upgrade means you won&#x27;t have to worry about your joysticks succumbing to the dreaded stick drift. Jackson Chen

Add Engadget on Google
GuliKit
There may not be any reports of
stick drift
with the
ROG Xbox Ally
yet, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there won&#x27;t be. If you&#x27;d rather not end up with joysticks that have a mind of their own, GuliKit revealed its latest
TMR Electromagnet Joystick Modules
made specifically for your Xbox handheld. GuliKit said it worked directly with Asus to develop these joystick upgrades, which match the exact dimensions of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X&#x27;s stock sticks. The aftermarket accessories company previously designed a Hall effect
joystick upgrade kit
for the ROG Ally X, but GuliKit said this mod features electromagnetic joysticks that not only address stick drift but are also more precise, durable, and power-efficient. GuliKit even made the joystick upgrades easy to install since there&#x27;s no soldering required, and you can fine-tune the calibration in the handheld&#x27;s system settings. It may feel excessive to spend more money on a gaming handheld that can cost up to $1,000, but neither the ROG Xbox Ally nor Ally X comes with Hall effect or electromagnetic joysticks. GuliKit&#x27;s joystick upgrade is already available to US customers on its
Amazon storefront
for $19.99. Advertisement
