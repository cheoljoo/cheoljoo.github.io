                <div class="summary">Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, reported another quarter of sustained sales growth in its earnings statement Wednesday, with $46.7 billion in revenue, a 56% increase compared to the same period last year. That growth was largely fueled by AI-dominated data center business, which saw a 56% year-over-year increase in revenue.
Nvidia also saw its net income grow substantially since last year. The company reported a net income of $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a 59% spike since the same period last year.
All told, the company brought in $41.1 billion in revenue from data center sales in the quarter, suggesting that AI companies’ demand for cutting-edge GPUs continues to grow. The company’s most advanced generation of chips, Blackwell, accounted for $27 billion of those sales.
“Blackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for,” said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement accompanying the release. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.”
Huang said that the company expects to see $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade.
The company made particular note of its role in the launch of
OpenAI’s open source gpt-oss models
earlier this month, which involved processing “1.5 million tokens per second on a single Nvidia Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system.”
The earnings also gave a look at Nvidia’s ongoing struggle to sell its chips in Chinese markets. The company reported no sales of its China-focused H20 chip to Chinese customers in the past quarter; Nvidia did report $650 million worth of H20 chips had been sold to a customer outside China.

Salesforce
is betting that rigorous testing in simulated business environments will solve one of enterprise artificial intelligence’s biggest problems: agents that work in demonstrations but fail in the messy reality of corporate operations.
The cloud software giant unveiled three major AI research initiatives this week, including
CRMArena-Pro
, what it calls a “
digital twin
” of business operations where AI agents can be stress-tested before deployment. The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with widespread AI pilot failures and fresh security concerns following recent breaches that compromised hundreds of Salesforce customer instances.
“Pilots don’t learn to fly in a storm; they train in flight simulators that push them to prepare in the most extreme challenges,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s chief scientist and head of AI research, during a press conference. “Similarly, AI agents benefit from simulation testing and training, preparing them to handle the unpredictability of daily business scenarios in advance of their deployment.”
The research push reflects growing enterprise frustration with AI implementations. A recent
MIT report
found that 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to reach production, while Salesforce’s own studies show that large language models alone achieve only 35% success rates in complex business scenarios.

Just weeks after being
confirmed by the Senate
, Susan Monarez has been ousted from the now thoroughly battered public health agency.
The news was first reported by
The Washington Post
, which cited multiple officials within the Trump administration. After Ars Technica contacted the Department of Health and Human Services for confirmation of the ouster, HHS responded with a link to a post on the department&#x27;s X account. The post states:
Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.
The department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez&#x27;s ouster. But
reporting from The New York Times
suggests that she had clashed with US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F.</div>

Vacancy rates plummet as data centers struggle to match unprecedented demand
Northern Virginia dominates capacity while emerging markets grow at an explosive pace
Developers rush projects, yet 73% of new capacity is already preleased
Data centers are becoming the backbone of digital infrastructure, with vacancy rates in North America now at an all-time low of 2.3%, new JLL research has claimed.
Despite inventory reaching 15.5GW in mid-2025, the pace of absorption continues to outstrip available capacity.
This mismatch is fueled by surging reliance on AI, digital transformation, and
cloud storage
services, which have created a supply crunch across both established and emerging markets.

development by 2030.
&quot;There was a significant increase in the amount of capital deployed into data center projects under construction or reaching stabilization in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year,” said Carl Beardsley, Senior Managing Director, Data Center Leader, JLL Capital Markets.

Tina Nguyen is a Senior Reporter for The Verge, covering the second Trump administration, political influencers, tech lobbying and Big Tech vs. Big Government.
On Wednesday, 4Chan and Kiwi Farms, two of the most controversial social media sites on the internet, filed a federal lawsuit against the British government, arguing that the requirements of the UK’s Online Safety Act infringe on their Constitutional rights as American corporations.
In a filing submitted to the U.S. District Court
in the District of Columbia, Preston Byrne and Ron Coleman, the team representing the two sites, said that their clients are being penalized by
Ofcom
, the agency that regulates online content in the United Kingdom, for “engaging in conduct which is perfectly lawful in the territories where their websites are based”.</div>

Apple iOS 26 public beta 5 is live: Here are all the new iPhone features coming in September
Here&#x27;s how you can access the beta OSes for iPhone and iPad, and when you can expect the final release.

Apple on Tuesday finally announced that its
iPhone 17 event
will take place on Tuesday, September 9. So in just under two weeks, we&#x27;ll get to take a first look at the new
iPhone 17 lineup
. If Apple keeps with tradition, expect to see
iOS 26
available for download about one week after the event. If you can&#x27;t wait any longer, you can
download and install
the newly released public beta 5 (or
iOS 26 developer beta 8
for developers). I&#x27;ve been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that
taking screenshots
is way better in the new operating system, as well as getting to
choose how long you snooze
. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our
preview of the iOS 26 public beta release
, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called
Liquid Glass
, the translucent look will extend across all of Apple&#x27;s upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS,
macOS
,
iPadOS
and the rest of Apple&#x27;s software suite, all of which were showcased during the company&#x27;s
WWDC keynote
on June 9.
After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you&#x27;ve been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it&#x27;s in the Photos app).
Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern.</div>

Apple isn’t the only tech company to
send out launch event invitations
this week. If you’re keeping score at home, September is actually
next week
somehow, and Samsung is sneaking a virtual Unpacked in on September 4th before Apple hosts its annual iPhone event the following week. But it’s not just a convenient date to try and steal a little bit of Apple’s thunder — it’s the day before IFA kicks off in Berlin. Related: the event starts at 5:30AM ET / 11:30AM CET.
The event invite doesn’t give much away about what Samsung intends to announce.</div>

Samsung will hold another Unpacked on September 4
New tablets and an S25 FE will likely make an appearance.

Samsung is hosting another Unpacked event on September 4, and this time it&#x27;ll only be available to watch virtually. The event will stream on
Samsung&#x27;s YouTube page
and
website
at 5:30AM ET, following the in-person launch events the company held for the
Galaxy S25 line
in January and the new
Galaxy Z Fold 7
and
Z Flip 7
in July.
With most of the company&#x27;s smartphone lineup accounted for, Samsung will likely use this Unpacked to introduce new tablets. The company announced the the
Galaxy Tab S10 Lite
earlier this week and now leaks point to a new Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra being in the works,
according to
Notebookcheck
.
The Tab S11 will reportedly feature an AMOLED screen, 12GB of RAM and a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chip, rather than Samsung&#x27;s preferred Qualcomm Snapdragon chips. The Tab S11 Ultra will have similar features, but with a larger AMOLED, up to 16GB of RAM, the same MediaTek chip and a larger 11,600mAh battery.
Odds are also good that Samsung will announce the Galaxy S25 FE, a cheaper alternative to the normal Galaxy S25. Based on the leaks
SamMobile
compiled
, the S25 FE will share many similarities with the
S24 FE
, save for an improved 12MP selfie camera, up from 10MP on the S24 FE, a larger 4,900mAh battery and faster wired charging speeds.
Provided you&#x27;re willing to get up early, you&#x27;ll be able to see for yourself when Samsung streams its next Unpacked event on September 4. It likely won&#x27;t be the last event the company holds this year, either. The
Project Moohan
Android XR headset and Samsung&#x27;s
first trifold phone
are also expected to be released in 2025.

Exabeam report claims AI is driving insider threats, that are now outpacing external cyberattacks
Most firms have insider programs, but lack advanced behavioral analytics needed for early detection
Generative AI agents create faster, stealthier risks that traditional defenses cannot easily catch
How organizations view insider risk is changing, according to a new
report
from Exabeam which claims insider threats have overtaken external attacks to become the number one security concern, and it’s mostly down to AI.
Nearly two thirds (64%) of respondents said they now see insiders, whether malicious or compromised, as a bigger danger than outside actors - and Generative AI is behind a rise in faster and stealthier attacks that are far harder to detect.
“Insiders aren’t just people anymore,&quot; warned Exabeam Chief AI and Product Officer, Steve Wilson. &quot;They’re AI agents logging in with valid credentials, spoofing trusted voices, and making moves at machine speed. The question isn’t just who has access - it’s whether you can spot when that access is being abused.”

Apple
is reportedly in discussion with Google to add Gemini to Private Cloud Compute, ready to power Siri with Apple Intelligence.
The news came from top insider
Mark Gurman
, who said, &quot;A few weeks ago, Apple approached the search giant about making a version of its Gemini AI models.&quot;
Gurman even said Google was developing this custom model right now with Apple&#x27;s involvement, pointing towards the potential for a Google Gemini-powered, Apple Intelligence-branded Siri.

As TechRadar&#x27;s Senior AI Writer, I test out all of the best AI models, and Google Gemini is up there with my favorite chatbots on the market.
Apple&#x27;s AI strategy has been underwhelming, to say the least, but reports of the Cupertino-based firm bringing in Google to superpower
Apple Intelligence
could be the best thing to happen to the iPhone in years.
Here are five reasons why I really hope Apple adds
Google Gemini
to Siri.
