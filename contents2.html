! It’s been a minute, folks! As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition. I spent the first week of the year at the
Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this
last January
, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building. What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (
Zoox
,
Tensor Auto
,
Tier IV
, and
Waymo
, which
rebranded its Zeekr RT
, to name a few), Chinese automakers like
Geely
and
GWM
, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
calls “physical AI.”
The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables. Hyundai
had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the
Atlas humanoid robot
, courtesy of its subsidiary
Boston Dynamics
. There were also innovations that have come out of
Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB
, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into p...</div>

Stop calling it &#x27;The AI bubble&#x27;: It&#x27;s actually multiple bubbles, each with a different expiration date
Val Bercovici, WEKA
January 18, 2026
CleoP made with Midjourney
It’s the question on everyone’s minds and lips: Are we in an AI bubble? It&#x27;s the wrong question. The real question is:
Which
AI bubble are we in, and when will each one burst? The debate over whether AI represents a
transformative technology
or an economic time bomb has reached a fever pitch. Even tech leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg have acknowledged evidence of an unstable financial bubble forming around AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates see clear bubble dynamics: overexcited investors, frothy valuations and plenty of doomed projects — but they still believe AI will ultimately transform the economy. But treating &quot;AI&quot; as a single monolithic entity destined for a uniform collapse is fundamentally misguided. The AI ecosystem is actually three distinct layers, each with different economics, defensibility and risk profiles. Understanding these layers is critical, because they won&#x27;t all pop at once. Layer 3: The wrapper companies (first to fall)
The most vulnerable segment isn&#x27;t building AI — it&#x27;s repackaging it. These are the companies that take OpenAI&#x27;s API, add a slick interface and some prompt engineering, then charge $49/month for what amounts to a glorified ChatGPT wrapper. Some have achieved rapid initial success, like
Jasper.ai
, which reached approximately $42 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in its first year by wrapping GPT models in a user-friendly interface for marketers. But the cracks are already showing. These businesses face threats from every direction:

The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a
study
published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance. “For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”
The social cost of carbon is an accounting method for working out the monetary cost of each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.</div>

Welcome to Night Vale
is the longest continually running fiction podcast out there. (Some will argue it’s actually
We’re Alive
, but that has taken a few significant breaks between seasons.) The story of Night Vale, the titular desert town, now spans 12 seasons, over 280 episodes,
three books
, and at least
10 live standalone shows
. While dedicating several hundred hours of your life to listening to every episode might seem like a big ask, I believe you’ll be hooked once you dive in. The show is written by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor, who draw heavily on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. Every season has its own arc, but broadly, the show tells the story of a tow...</div>
