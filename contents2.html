fracking
a second act, a surprising twist for an industry that, even during its early 2010s boom years, was blamed by climate advocates for poisoned water tables, man-made earthquakes, and the stubborn persistence of fossil fuels.
AI companies are building massive data centers near major gas-production sites, often generating their own power by tapping directly into fossil fuels. It’s a trend that’s been overshadowed by headlines about the intersection of AI and healthcare (and solving climate change), but it’s one that could reshape — and raise difficult questions for — the communities that host these facilities.
Take the latest example. This week, the Wall Street Journal
reported
that AI coding assistant startup Poolside is constructing a data center complex on more than 500 acres in West Texas — about 300 miles west of Dallas — a footprint two-thirds the size of Central Park. The facility will generate its own power by tapping natural gas from the Permian Basin, the nation’s most productive oil and gas field, where hydraulic fracturing isn’t just common but really the only game in town.
The project, dubbed Horizon, will produce two gigawatts of computing power. That’s equivalent to the Hoover Dam’s entire electric capacity, except instead of harnessing the Colorado River, it’s burning fracked gas. Poolside is developing the facility with CoreWeave, a cloud computing company that rents out access to Nvidia AI chips and that’s supplying access to more than 40,000 of them. The Journal calls it an “energy Wild West,” which seems apt.
Yet Poolside is far from alone. Nearly all the major AI players are pursuing similar strategies. Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman toured his company’s flagship Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas — around 200 miles from the Permian Basin — where he was candid, saying, “
We’re burning gas to run this data center

                <div class="summary">Cisco warns enterprises: Without tapping machine data, your AI strategy is incomplete
Louis Columbus
October 17, 2025

Cisco executives make the case that the distinction between product and model companies is disappearing, and that accessing the 55% of enterprise data growth that current AI ignores will separate winners from losers.
VentureBeat recently caught up with Jeetu Patel,
Cisco&#x27;s
President and Chief Product Officer and DJ Sampath, Senior Vice President of AI Software and Platform, to gain new insights into a compelling thesis both leaders share. They and their teams contend that every successful product company must become an AI model company to survive the next decade.
When one considers how compressed product lifecycles are becoming, combined with the many advantages of digital twin technology to accelerate time-to-market of next-gen products, the thesis makes sense.
The conversation revealed why this transformation is inevitable, backed by solid data points. The team contends that 55% of all data growth is machine data that current AI models don&#x27;t touch. OpenAI&#x27;s Greg Brockman estimates we need 10 billion GPUs to give every human the AI agents they&#x27;ll need, and Cisco&#x27;s open source security model, Foundation-Sec-8B, has already seen 200,000 downloads on Hugging Face.
Why the model is becoming the product
VentureBeat: You&#x27;ve stated that in the future, every product company will become a model company. Why is this inevitable rather than just one possible path?
Jeetu Patel:
In the future, there&#x27;s no distinction between model companies and product companies. Great product companies will be model companies. The close tie-in between model and product is a closed loop. To enhance the product, you enhance the model, not just a UI shim.
These companies being formed right now that are a thin shim on top of a model; their days are numbered. The true moat is the model you build that drives product behavior.</div>

In 1890, a German scientist named
Robert Koch
thought he’d invented a cure for tuberculosis, a substance derived from the infecting bacterium itself that he dubbed Tuberculin. His substance didn’t actually cure anyone, but it was eventually widely used as a
diagnostic skin test
. Koch’s successful failure is just one of the many colorful cases featured in
Dead Ends! Flukes, Flops, and Failures
that Sparked Medical Marvels
, a new nonfiction illustrated children’s book by science historian Lindsey Fitzharris and her husband, cartoonist Adrian Teal.
A noted science communicator with a fondness for the medically macabre, Fitzharris published a biography of surgical pioneer Joseph Lister,
The Butchering Art
, in 2017—a great, if occasionally grisly, read. She followed up with 2022’s
The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon’s Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I
, about a WWI surgeon named Harold Gillies
who rebuilt
the faces of injured soldiers.
And in 2020, she hosted a documentary for the Smithsonian Channel,
The Curious Life and Death Of
…, exploring famous deaths, ranging from drug lord Pablo Escobar to magician Harry Houdini. Fitzharris performed virtual autopsies, experimented with blood samples, interviewed witnesses, and conducted real-time demonstrations in hopes of gleaning fresh insights. For his part, Teal is a well-known caricaturist and illustrator, best known for his work on the British TV series

Apple&#x27;s M5 has appeared in a benchmark leak with Geekbench
It posted an impressive single-core result for CPU performance, beating out Qualcomm&#x27;s powerful Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme SoC
The M5 is also shown getting the better of some beefy desktop CPUs, but we need to tread carefully here
If you were wondering how fast
Apple&#x27;s new M5 chip
might be, the answer is pretty nippy indeed, going by the grapevine.
As
Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports
, the M5, which is the engine of the
new MacBook Pro 14-inch
(and refreshed
iPad Pro
as well as the
Vision Pro
), is actually faster
than
Qualcomm&#x27;s new Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme
for single-core performance, based on a leaked Geekbench result that Tech Info highlighted on X.

Sprinkle on some seasoning, but as you can see in the above post, the comparison on X is between the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with M5 chip (10-core), where the laptop wins out - showing the advantages of better cooling and thermals with a notebook chassis. The M5 in the MacBook Pro is shown running at 4.61GHz compared to 4.43GHz in the iPad Pro.</div>

Modern gadgets are all well and good, but sometimes things get more exciting when you enter the realm of fantasy. And the worlds of gaming, TV, and film often feature extremely cool gadgets that we just wish were real, whether it’s
an impossible VR headset
or
a smartphone powered by a ghost
. So, every so often, we decide to treat them as if they
were
real, and review science fiction gizmos the same way we would
the latest iPhone
or
Switch
. Keep up with them all right here.

Though the
Pokémon
games’ Rotom Phones haven’t really changed all that much design-wise over the past few years, each generation has introduced new functionalities that made upgrading a no-brainer.

’s
Rotom Phone — the very first one — came with a bare-bones camera that made it easy to snap wide-angle (screen)shots out in the Galar region’s Wild Area. The second-generation Rotom Phone’s camera in
Scarlet

was a significant improvement, but the device’s real standout feature was its ability to
keep you from plummeting to your death

Facebook&#x27;s latest AI feature can scan your phone&#x27;s camera roll
The opt-in feature can suggest hidden gems and edit them into something worth sharing.

Meta
A Facebook feature that scans your phone&#x27;s photo library to make AI collages and edits is
now available
in North America. Meta
tested it
earlier this year. It&#x27;s an opt-in feature, but the company may train its models on your media if you use its AI editing or share the results.
From a user experience perspective, the idea is to help you find &quot;hidden gems&quot; in your library and turn them into something shareable. After scanning your photo library (with your permission), it will cough up suggestions. For example, it might recommend a collage based on a vacation, a recap of a graduation party or simply spruce up some photos with AI. For better or worse, it&#x27;s another step in the direction of automating creativity and skill.
Zooming out to Meta&#x27;s business motives, it&#x27;s easy to imagine this is a move for more AI training data. The company says it won&#x27;t train its AI on your camera roll &quot;unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share.&quot; If you find it useful enough to use, your media may help train Meta&#x27;s AI models.

The company says the feature&#x27;s suggestions are private to you until you choose to share them. Its permissions state, &quot;To create ideas for you, we&#x27;ll select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis, based on info like time, location or themes.&quot; However, Meta says your media won&#x27;t be used for ad targeting.
Fortunately, it&#x27;s opt-in, so you can safely ignore this altogether without privacy worries. If you grant it permission, you&#x27;ll see its suggestions (visible only to you) in Stories and Feed.</div>

        </div>

                <div class="summary">The sprawling metropolis of Phoenix continues to be a testbed for Waymo, and not just on the technical front. The Alphabet-owned company has used its first testing and commercial market to experiment with its business model, too, including delivery.
Waymo is known for its robotaxis, but it has tested how its tech could be used for delivery. The company previously
tapped UPS
and Uber Eats for pilot programs, and it also put considerable staff and resources towards developing self-driving trucks under its
Waymo Via arm
, before shuttering that program in 2023 to focus on robotaxis.
Now, it seems Waymo is ready to test the delivery waters through a strategic, multi-year partnership with DoorDash. Waymo doesn’t have any other active delivery-focused testing, operations, or partnerships, according to a company spokesperson.
The partnership will match DoorDash customers ordering food and groceries within a 315-square-mile area of Phoenix with a self-driving Waymo, the company wrote in a
blog post
.
Not every DoorDash order will result in a Waymo delivery. Initially, the Waymo delivery service will deliver orders from DashMart — DoorDash’s convenience, grocery, and retail stores. The companies said that, over time, more local Phoenix merchants and a wider variety of offerings will be added.
David Richter, Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at DoorDash, said the deal with Waymo will give customers a “new and delightful experience, while advancing our vision for a multi-modal autonomous
future of local commerce.”
DoorDash isn’t new to the autonomous vehicle technology arena. The company has
partnered with sidewalk delivery bot company
Serve Robotics to cover parts of Los Angeles. It also has its own in-house autonomous vehicle tech team that developed and produced an
autonomous delivery bot
called Dot. The delivery bot, which was revealed in September, is being tested in the Phoenix area.
The deal with Waymo won’t involve DoorDash’s Dot vehicle, however.</div>

How Anthropic’s ‘Skills’ make Claude faster, cheaper, and more consistent for business workflows
Michael Nuñez
October 16, 2025
Anthropic
launched a new capability on Thursday that allows its
Claude AI
assistant to tap into specialized expertise on demand, marking the company&#x27;s latest effort to make artificial intelligence more practical for enterprise workflows as it chases rival OpenAI in the intensifying competition over AI-powered software development.
The feature, called
Skills
, enables users to create folders containing instructions, code scripts, and reference materials that Claude can automatically load when relevant to a task. The system marks a fundamental shift in how organizations can customize AI assistants, moving beyond one-off prompts to reusable packages of domain expertise that work consistently across an entire company.
&quot;Skills are based on our belief and vision that as model intelligence continues to improve, we&#x27;ll continue moving towards general-purpose agents that often have access to their own filesystem and computing environment,&quot; said Mahesh Murag, a member of Anthropic&#x27;s technical staff, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;The agent is initially made aware only of the names and descriptions of each available skill and can choose to load more information about a particular skill when relevant to the task at hand.&quot;
The launch comes as Anthropic, valued at
$183 billion after a recent $13 billion funding round
, projects its annual revenue could nearly triple to as much as $26 billion in 2026, according to a recent
Reuters report
. The company is currently approaching a $7 billion annual revenue run rate, up from $5 billion in August, fueled largely by enterprise adoption of its AI coding tools — a market where it faces fierce competition from OpenAI&#x27;s recently upgraded Codex platform.</div>

OnePlus is expected to take the wraps off the OnePlus 15 in the next few weeks, but before that, it&#x27;s giving us a look at the software that will run on it. OxygenOS 16, which is based on Android 16, will also come to the company&#x27;s other supported phones, and it&#x27;s going to include a heaping helping of AI features. OnePlus was
slower than most
smartphone makers to embrace AI, but it&#x27;s full-steam ahead now with new Gemini integrations.
OxygenOS 16
is described by OnePlus in grandiose terms as &quot;a defiant rebellion for authenticity.&quot; In the real world, this update is doing a lot of the same things as other AI-heavy smartphones. It&#x27;s not
all
AI—OnePlus notes that OxygenOS 16 will include revamped animations that have been carefully designed for smoothness, as well as the O+ remote app that gives you remote access to Windows and Mac PCs. The lock screen is also more customizable, borrowing a page from the likes of Apple and Samsung.
OnePlus began embracing AI in June, when it launched a feature called Mind Space on the OnePlus 13S. That phone was only for the Indian market, but the rest of the world will get this and more with OxygenOS 16. At launch, Mind Space would collect your screenshots and brief voice messages. Mind Space would analyze the screenshots to create calendar entries and not much else.
The updated Android software expands what you can add to Mind Space and uses Gemini. For starters, you can add scrolling screenshots and voice memos up to 60 seconds in length. This provides more data for the AI to generate content.</div>

Windows 10 end of life means only newer hardware can stay fully supported
Older Intel and AMD chips will lose security and compatibility updates
Check processor generation before buying new or used computers
Windows 10
has
finally reached its end of its life
and users looking to buy a new or second-hand computer need to be careful.
Any PC without
Windows 11
support will no longer receive updates, leaving it
exposed to security risks and compatibility problems
. Provided you’re running a
good antivirus
and
anti-malware program
that won’t be too much of an issue short term, but it will be down the line.
Windows 11 introduced stricter hardware requirements than any previous version of
Microsoft
’s
operating system
. This includes needing TPM 2.0 support, Secure Boot compatibility, and built-in security mitigations.

Windows 10 End of Life - what does it mean for PC gamers?
Check your processor
Because of these restrictions, many older CPUs simply can’t run Windows 11.
That includes many systems running
Intel
’s 7th generation Core processors and older, as well as early
AMD
Ryzen chips.
These restrictions mean that older processors lack the underlying design features to meet Microsoft’s new security and reliability goals.</div>
