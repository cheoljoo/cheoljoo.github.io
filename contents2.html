                <div class="summary">Facebook is
rolling out features
that aim to bring fans closer to their favorite creators: fan challenges and customized top fan badges.
The fan challenges feature will allow creators to prompt their followers with specific challenges. Followers can  participate by making a reel or a post as a response. To encourage more engagement and participation, the particular challenge hashtag will appear in a leaderboard that ranks the submissions in order of how many reactions it gets.
These kinds of challenges have been popular on short form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, where users may participate in informal dance challenges, or riff on trending audio clips. Facebook is formalizing the trend into an actual feature by creating a landing page for specific creators’ challenges.

In one example, Facebook suggests a cooking creator could celebrate fall by inviting fans to share videos of their favorite recipes involving butternut squash.
Kalen Allen, a creator with 3.6 million Facebook followers,
tested the feature
with a challenge asking fans to make videos about their dreams and goals, yielding about 520 entries. Meta says fans have submitted 1.5 million challenge entries over the last three months, while the feature was being tested.
Facebook is also allowing creators to customize the “top fan” badges that appear next to users’ names who engage most with their content. So, instead of being designated just a “top fan” of Ed Sheeran, you can be a “Sheerio,” if that’s your thing. Other celebrities like Cardi B and J Balvin have also enabled custom badges.
Facebook generally isn’t regarded as being as creator-centric as Instagram, which recently celebrated its
3 billion monthly active user milestone
. It’s more the kind of place you’d go to read the latest drama about bike lanes in your neighborhood Facebook group, or where you’ll accidentally encounter

Google plans to begin testing its
recently announced verification scheme
for Android developers in the coming weeks, but there&#x27;s still precious little information on how the process will work. F-Droid, the free and open source app repository, isn&#x27;t waiting for the full rollout to take a position. In a blog post, F-Droid staff say that Google&#x27;s plan to force devs outside Google Play to register with the company threatens to kill alternative app stores like F-Droid.
F-Droid has been around for about 15 years and is the largest source of free and open source software (FOSS) for Android. Because the apps in F-Droid are not installed via the Play Store, you have to sideload each APK manually, and Google is targeting that process in the name of security.
Several weeks ago, Google announced plans to force all Android app developers to register their apps and identity with Google. Apps that have not been validated by the Big G will not be installable on any certified Android devices in the future. Since virtually every Android device outside of China runs Google services, that means Google is in control of the software we get to install on Android.
According to F-Droid
, Google&#x27;s verification program threatens to break free app distribution. Google claims that attaching real identities to apps reduces the incidence of malware, which it has seen in action in Google Play. Still, the Play Store is
not free of bad apps
, which F-Droid points to as evidence that Google&#x27;s moves won&#x27;t actually eliminate the risks of sideloading.

Cybercriminals exploit copyright fear to push malware into everyday online spaces
Telegram bots now double as command hubs for evolving malware threats
Fake legal firms deliver malware through takedown scams in multiple languages
Cybercriminals have long relied on fear as a way to manipulate victims, and copyright claims are proving to be one of the latest tools of choice.
Research by
Cofense Intelligence
found attackers are sending messages designed to look like legitimate takedown requests to multiple users.
However, the real intention of these messages is to deliver
malware
under the guise of legal pressure.

A campaign built on deception
The report outlined how a Vietnamese threat actor referred to as Lone None has been distributing campaigns that spoof legal firms, sending messages which claim to flag copyright-infringing content on the target’s website or social media account.
What makes this wave of activity notable is the use of multiple languages, suggesting reliance on machine translation or
AI tools
to generate convincing templates across regions.
Victims are pressured into following links, which, instead of solving an alleged copyright problem, lead to malware downloads.

Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or replacing a well-used older pair, it’s easy to understand why so many iPhone owners prefer Apple’s earbuds and headphones over other options. Apple has spent years gradually adding new features that work best — and sometimes
only
work at all — with the company’s own devices. These convenient tricks include audio sharing, automatic switching between Apple’s various devices, live translation, Apple TV integration, and more.

Reporter Marisa Kabas, founder of
The Handbasket
, posted on Bluesky today that more than
1.7 million
subscribers canceled their paid Disney streaming plans between September 17 and September 23. The total allegedly includes subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. That falloff reportedly marked a 436 percent increase over the usual churn rate for the service. We’ve reached out to Disney+ for comment on this claim.
Disney also chose to
increase subscription prices
last week, which could prolong the wave of
cancellations
. Kabas&#x27; source also
claimed
that Disney sped the return of the late night show because it had planned to announce the price hike last Tuesday.
In case you need a reminder of the entertainment news that dominated headlines for the past two weeks, Disney-owned ABC suspended the late night talk show
Jimmy Kimmel Live
on September 17 after President Donald Trump and members of his administration accused the host of making inappropriate comments regarding the assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk. Although Disney then
announced
on September 22 that the program would be reinstated the following night, it seems a lot of viewers were not impressed with the company&#x27;s actions.

                <div class="summary">It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom:
In 2019
, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come
in the form of Azure cloud credit
rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would
no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively
, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more in...</div>

We love games here at the Ars Orbiting HQ, from modern to ancient and all points in between. With that in mind, we&#x27;ve partnered with the folks at GOG.com to create a store page featuring a
curated list of some of our favorites from GOG&#x27;s catalog
. At the end of every month, we&#x27;ll rotate a couple of titles off the list and add a few new ones; altogether, we have a list of about 50 games to set in front of you.
Twice a month, we&#x27;ll publish a personal retrospective like this one, where we&#x27;ll feature one of the games from the list—perhaps a retro game you&#x27;ve heard of, perhaps a modern title you missed. Regardless, GOG will have a DRM-free version of the game ready to go. Be sure to check out
the earlier pieces in the series
!
I love 4X games. I&#x27;ve tried other strategy game genres, but frankly, they don&#x27;t stick if they&#x27;re not first and foremost 4X games—at the heart of it, it must be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and yes, exterminating.
I suspect that the first 4X game most people played was some entry in the Civilization franchise—though certainly, a select few played precursors dating back to text-based games in the 1970s.
But for me, the title that kicked off my obsession was
Master of Orion II
(
MOO2
)—a game that has you develop and build up planets across a simple galaxy map, researching speculative future technologies, and ultimately wip...</div>

Here’s how it works

Crude GPU design showed random glitches whenever the system attempted memory writes
iNapGPU struggled with environmental noise from simple USB cables
A 12MHz counter overclocked to 20MHz caused constant instability
An obscure project on
GitHub
shows how a hardware hobbyist tried to construct what he called the “second world’s worst video card,” a text-mode
graphics card
using only TTL gates.
Working under the handle Leoneq, he released the “iNapGPU” repository to document his experiment.
His goal was to outdo
Ben Eater’s “world’s worst video card”
by making something even less practical.

A Chinese GPU vendor you&#x27;ve never heard of wants to challenge Nvidia and AMD in the pro market with 24GB VRAM - surely it cannot succeed?
A dual Intel GPU graphics card with 48GB of VRAM has gone on sale for $1200 - now I wonder whether you could plug two of these into a workstation
A minimal design that still exceeded true VGA limits
Despite deliberately using crude methods, he could not reduce the output below a basic VGA resolution.
The project specifications list VGA output at 800 x 600 (actually SVGA) @60Hz, with an accessible resolution of 400 x 300 in monochrome.
The hardware was built from 21 integrated circuits, including counters, NAND gates, and an EPROM working with a small SRAM.
By treating a 1-Mbit EPROM as a 1-bit memory, Leoneq could load up to four character sets of 255 characters each.

For most of his career Larry Ellison has been content to quietly let Oracle be the company, behind the company, behind the technology that makes headlines. Its biggest products being cloud computing and database products that it sells to enterprise customers like DHL, Northwell Health, and Fanatics. But, now in his 80s, Ellison has begun a second act shifting from Silicon Valley pioneer, to media mogul.
Compared to many of the other people at the top of the
Forbes Billionaires
list, Larry Ellison tends to keep a low profile. That’s not to say he hasn’t seen his fair share of headlines, especially in recent years. But he, and his company Oracle, aren’t being routinely dragged

Business Insider
has obtained the guidelines that Meta contractors are reportedly now using to train its AI chatbots, showing how it&#x27;s attempting to more effectively address potential child sexual exploitation and prevent kids from engaging in age-inappropriate conversations. The company said in August
that it was updating the guardrails for its AIs
after
Reuters
reported that its policies allowed the chatbots to &quot;engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,&quot; which Meta said at the time was &quot;erroneous and inconsistent&quot; with its policies and removed that language.
The document, which
Business Insider
has shared an excerpt from, outlines what kinds of content are &quot;acceptable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; for its AI chatbots. It explicitly bars content that &quot;enables, encourages, or endorses&quot; child sexual abuse, romantic roleplay if the user is a minor or if the AI is asked to roleplay as a minor, advice about potentially romantic or intimate physical contact if the user is a minor, and more. The chatbots can discuss topics such as abuse, but cannot engage in conversations that could enable or encourage it.
The
company&#x27;s AI chatbots
have been
the subject of
numerous
reports in recent months
that have raised concerns about their potential harms to children. The FTC in August launched
a formal inquiry into companion AI chatbots
not just from Meta, but other companies as well, including Alphabet, Snap, OpenAI and X.AI.
