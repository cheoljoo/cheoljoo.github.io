A quick bit of breaking news that hit just as we were about to send this newsletter out. The
National Transportation Safety Board
has opened an investigation into
Waymo
after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.
Read the full story here
.
Now onto our regular programming …
Tesla
made a couple of moves this week — and just before its quarterly earnings drops — designed to show its progress, and even dominance, in automated driving technology. But, hold up, there is more to it than mere optics.
The week started with Tesla offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin
without a human safety driver
in the front seat. If you recall, Tesla launched a limited service in Austin last year with a fleet of modified Tesla Model Y vehicles running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software known as Full Self-Driving Supervised (this one being “unsupervised”). Human safety operators have been riding in the front passenger seat as a precaution since the rollout.
Not all of Tesla’s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless, and there is apparently a chase vehicle behind those that are. Still, it is notable and suggests Tesla is moving toward a broader ramp-up.
Meanwhile,
Tesla has killed Autopilot
, the advanced driver-assistance system that was initially introduced to its vehicles in 2014. Autopilot has gone through several software and hardware iterations over the years with new capabilities.

Conversational AI doesn’t understand users — &#x27;Intent First&#x27; architecture does
Sreenivasa Reddy Hulebeedu Reddy

The modern customer has just one need that matters: Getting
the thing
they want
when they want it
. The old standard RAG model
embed+retrieve+LLM
misunderstands intent, overloads context and misses freshness, repeatedly sending customers down the wrong paths.
Instead, intent-first architecture uses a lightweight language model to parse the query for intent and context, before delivering to the most relevant content sources (documents, APIs, people).
Enterprise AI is a speeding train headed for a cliff. Organizations are deploying LLM-powered search applications at a record pace, while a fundamental architectural issue is setting most up for failure.
A recent Coveo study revealed that
72% of enterprise search queries fail
to deliver meaningful results on the first attempt, while Gartner also predicts that the majority of conversational AI deployments have been falling short of enterprise expectations.
The problem isn’t the underlying models. It’s the architecture around them.
After designing and running live AI-driven customer interaction platforms at scale, serving millions of customer and citizen users at some of the world’s largest telecommunications and healthcare organizations, I’ve come to see a pattern. It’s the difference between successful
AI-powered interaction deployments
and multi-million-dollar failures.
It’s a cloud-native
architecture
pattern that I call
Intent-First
. And it’s reshaping the way enterprises build AI-powered experiences.
The $36 pillion problem
Gartner projects the global conversational AI market will balloon to
$36 billion by 2032
. Enterprises are scrambling to get a slice. The demos are irresistible. Plug your
LLM into your knowledge base
, and suddenly it can answer customer questions in natural language.Magic.
Then production happens.

A decade is a long time for a TV series; no single iteration of
Star Trek
has made it that far.
But “a
Star Trek
podcast by two guys just a little bit embarrassed to have a
Star Trek
podcast” has now passed the milestone. January 25, 2026, marks a full decade since
The Greatest Generation
, my favorite podcast, debuted. Like a bottle of Château Picard, the show
has only improved with age. (I
interviewed the guys behind the show
back in 2016 when they were just getting started.)
The podcast helped me rediscover, and appreciate more fully,
Star Trek: The Next Generation—
which is also my favorite TV show.
The Greatest Generation
continues to delight with its irreverent humor, its celebration of the most minor of characters, and its technical fascination with how a given episode was made.
Over the last decade, hosts Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica have both moved to Los Angeles and become full-time podcasters. They have completed an episode-by-episode recap of all of
The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine,
and
Voyager
, and they’re now nearing the end of
Enterprise.
When finished, they’re threatening/promising to start over again.
The podcast has spawned its own (sometimes NSFW!) lexicon (a “friend of DeSoto” means a listener to and fan of
The Greatest Generation
), its own recurring and hilarious segments (“Drunk Shimoda,” “Bad Bit Moment,” and “Polo? Polo? Or Pollo?”), and most importantly, its own delightful fandom. It’s the coolest and dorkiest secret club that I will ever be a part of.
In 2016, the podcast was folded into the
Maximum Fun
organization. Harrison and Pranica formed their own company, Uxbridge-Shimoda...</div>

Robots still fail quickly once removed from predictable factory environments
Microsoft Rho-alpha links language understanding directly to robotic motion control
Tactile sensing is central to narrowing gaps between software and physical action
Robots have long performed reliably inside tightly controlled industrial settings with predictable environments and limited deviations, but outside of that, they often struggle.
To alleviate this issue,
Microsoft
has announced
Rho-alpha
, the first robotics model derived from its Phi vision-language series, arguing robots need better ways to see and understand instructions
The company believes systems can operate beyond assembly lines by responding to changing conditions rather than following rigid scripts.

What Rho-alpha is designed to do
Microsoft links this to what is widely being called physical AI, where software models are expected to guide machines through less structured situations.

Creators and communities everywhere take a stand against ICE
Even the most seemingly apolitical creators have had enough.

is the Verge’s weekend editor. He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.
It’s not surprising when the guy who’s been yelling about the horrors of late-stage capitalism on Instagram for the last five years turns his ire towards ICE. But something different has been happening over the week or so, following the most recent shootings of civilians by federal agents — even accounts that stay laser focused on
golfing
, chopping wood, and playing cats like bongos have started to speak out.
The tenor on social media and Reddit took an even sharper turn yesterday, following the
killing of Alex Pretti
by ICE. Even the moderator of normally politics-free r/catbongos (a subreddit “Where gentlemen, gentlewomen, and gentlethems of quality gather to watch cats being played like bongos”) spokeout in a
post
where they declared that “If you still support Trump/ICE even slightly, you’re not welcome in this sub.”

Microsoft releases second emergency Windows 11 update to fix Outlook crashes
This out-of-band update comes a week after a previous one fixing some Windows 11 devices not being able to shut down.

Microsoft issued another out-of-band update to fix a bug that caused
Outlook
to crash for Windows 11 users. This second
emergency patch
addresses issues seen with Outlook and files stored in the cloud following Microsoft&#x27;s January 2026 Windows security update.
According to Microsoft, this update fixes a bug where some apps that &quot;open or save files stored in cloud-backed locations&quot; became unresponsive or displayed error messages. Some users also experienced Outlook crashing or not opening when PST files are stored in cloud-based options like OneDrive.
This is the second time this year that Microsoft had to issue a last-minute fix for bugs related to its January security update.
Last week
, some Windows 11 devices couldn&#x27;t shut down or hibernate, while other devices running Windows 10 or 11 couldn&#x27;t log in through remote connections. For more context, Microsoft only issues out-of-band updates when there&#x27;s a serious issue that can&#x27;t wait until its regular update cycle. Fortunately, the latest out-of-band update is cumulative, so you only need to download and install this one to fix the issues seen with the January update.

There were times at this week’s meeting of the World Economic Forum when Davos seemed transformed into a high-powered tech conference, with on-stage appearances by
Tesla CEO Elon Musk
,
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
,
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei
,
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
, and even more industry executives.
The big topic, unsurprisingly, was AI, with CEOs laying a vision for the technology’s transformative potential while also acknowledging ongoing concerns that they’re inflating a massive bubble. Amidst all that big-picture prognostication, they also found time to take swipes at their competitors, and even at their ostensible partners.
On the latest episode of
TechCrunch’s Equity podcast
, I discussed all things Davos with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec and Sean O’Kane.
Kirsten noted that the conference seemed transformed from past years, with tech companies like Meta and Salesforce taking over the main promenade, while important topics like climate change failed to draw crowds. And Sean said that even if AI execs weren’t
quite
“panhandling for usage and more customers,” it could sometimes feel that way.
Read a preview of our full conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.
Kirsten:
Some of the discussions around, let’s say, climate change or poverty and big global problems, [are] not really attracting the crowds. Meanwhile, on the main promenade in Davos, Switzerland, some of the biggest storefronts have been converted and taken over by companies like Meta and Salesforce, Tata, also a lot of Middle East countries. And I think the largest was the USA House, which was sponsored by McKinsey and Microsoft. It really felt visually different.
And then Elon Musk being there — Sean, you and I both listened to it. There wasn’t a lot of there there, but I will say that it was interesting that he showed up, because in the past he has avoided Davos.

Claude Cowork is now available to more Claude users, alongside new updates aimed at team workflows.
Anthropic made Claude Cowork accessible to users on Team and Enterprise plans, and it brings the platform closer to being a collaborative AI infrastructure. For enterprise teams, the change matters less as a feature update than as a shift in how Claude is meant to be used. Cowork reframes Claude as a shared, persistent workspace where context, files, and tasks live beyond a single user session. This aligns more closely with how teams actually operate than one-off chat interactions.
Cowork,
released earlier in January
, lets people complete non-technical tasks in the same asynchronous way they use Claude Code. It was initially limited to Claude Max subscribers.
Enterprise and Teams users who can access Claude Cowork can begin building workflows for their non-technical, or no-code, projects and even create entirely new files within the folders they have access to. However, Anthropic did not say whether Cowork projects or files are transferable between users, even within the same Enterprise or Team plan.
That uncertainty could matter for enterprises evaluating Cowork as a system of record rather than a personal productivity tool. Questions around ownership, access, and continuity — such as what happens to shared AI-generated work when an employee leaves — are increasingly central as organizations move AI into production workflows. Now that more people across Claude’s paid tiers can use Cowork, Anthropic is extending AI-assisted workflows beyond developers and into broader teams.
As more teams experiment with AI-assisted workflows, tools originally designed for coding are increasingly being repurposed for coordination, do...</div>

Researchers on Friday said that Poland’s electric grid was targeted by wiper malware, likely unleashed by Russia state hackers, in an attempt to disrupt electricity delivery operations.
A cyberattack,
Reuters reported
, occurred during the last week of December. The news organization said it was aimed at disrupting communications between renewable installations and the power distribution operators but failed for reasons not explained.
Wipers R Us
On Friday, security firm ESET
said
the malware responsible was a wiper, a type of malware that permanently erases code and data stored on servers with the goal of destroying operations completely. After studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in the attack, company researchers said the wiper was likely the work of a Russian government hacker group tracked under the name Sandworm.
“Based on our analysis of the malware and associated TTPs, we attribute the attack to the Russia-aligned Sandworm APT with medium confidence due to a strong overlap with numerous previous Sandworm wiper activity we analyzed,” said ESET researchers. “We’re not aware of any successful disruptio...</div>

The PRVKE is the poster child for Wandrd – being its best-selling, versatile backpack, available in three sizes and seven muted colors. I tested the mid-range 21L version of the latest V4 model, which has space for a mid-range mirrorless camera, a couple of spare lenses and accessories (in the optional cube), plus a laptop, tablet, and a few day items. For me, the big selling point is the PRVKE V4&#x27;s stylish roll-top exterior – it doesn&#x27;t scream camera bag, yet inside it can hold thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of gear, with a quick side access pocket for your camera. It&#x27;s comfortable, durable, well laid out and will likely be my primary day bag going forward.
