                <div class="summary">Cloud data company Snowflake entered into a
$200 million multi-year AI deal
with OpenAI on Monday, the latest signal that enterprise AI competition continues to heat up.
Under the deal, Snowflake’s 12,600 customers will have access to OpenAI models across all three major cloud providers. Snowflake employees have access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise as well. The two companies are also partnering to build new AI agents and other AI products.
“By bringing OpenAI models to enterprise data, Snowflake enables organizations to build and deploy AI on top of their most valuable asset using the secure, governed platform they already trust,” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said in a press release. “Customers can now harness all their enterprise knowledge in Snowflake together with the world-class intelligence of OpenAI models, enabling them to build AI agents that are powerful, responsible, and trustworthy. Together, we’re setting a new standard for AI innovation, helping businesses transform with confidence, while maintaining strong security and compliance standards.”
OpenAI declined to share information on the deal beyond the press release.
If this deal feels familiar, it should. Snowflake announced a
$200 million enterprise deal with AI research lab Anthropic
at the beginning of December. At the time, Ramaswamy was quoted making very similar comments about how the partnership with Anthropic would give its customers access to powerful AI models on top of their existing data.
“Our partnership with OpenAI is a multi-year commercial commitment focused on reliability, performance, and real customer usage. At the same time, we remain intentionally model-agnostic. Enterprises need choice, and we do not believe in locking customers into a single provider,” Baris Gultekin, vice president of AI at Snowflake, told TechCrunch over email. “OpenAI is an important partner, and it is one of...</div>

The key to successful AI agents within an enterprise? Shared memory and context.
This, according to
Asana
CPO Arnab Bose, provides detailed history and direct access from the get-go — with guardrail checkpoints and human oversight, of course.
This way, “when you assign a task, you&#x27;re not having to go ahead and re-provide all of the context about how your business works,” Bose said at a recent VB event in San Francisco.
AI as an active teammate, rather than a passive add-on
Asana launched Asana AI Teammates last year with the philosophy that, just like humans, AI agents should be plugged directly into a team or project to create a collaborative system. To further this mission, the project management company has
fully integrated with Anthropic’s Claude
.
Users can choose from 12 pre-built agents — for common use cases like IT ticket deflection — or build their own, then assign them to project teams and immediately provide a historical record of what tasks have already been completed and what is still yet to be resolved. Agents also have access to third-party resources like Microsoft 365 or Google Drive.
“When that agent gets created, it&#x27;s not acting on behalf of someone, it manifests itself as a teammate and it gets all of the same sharing permissions, it inherits that,” Bose explained. Everything anyone does — humans and AI included — is documented to allow for “ease of explainability” and a “very transparent and trustworthy system.”
But just like human workers, AI agents are kept in check: Critically, workflows incorporate checkpoints, where humans can give feedback and ask the agent to tweak certain elements of a project or adjust research plans. This is documented in what Bose called a “very human-readable way.”
Also importantly, the UI provides instruction...</div>

The Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on Friday included at least a few dozen unredacted nude photos and names of at least 43 victims, according to news reports.
The DOJ missed a December 19 deadline set by the
Epstein Files Transparency Act
by more than a month, but still released the files without fully redacting nude photos and names of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. The New York Times
reported
yesterday that it found “nearly 40 unredacted images that appeared to be part of a personal photo collection, showing both nude bodies and the faces of the people portrayed.”
While the people in the photos were young, “it was unclear whether they were minors,” the article said. “Some of the images seemed to show Mr. Epstein’s private island, including a beach. Others were taken in bedrooms and other private spaces.” The photos “appeared to show at least seven different people,” the article said.
The Times said it notified government officials of the nude images and that the pictures have since been “largely removed o...</div>

Make no mistake – I&#x27;m a big Lego fan and build sets across all kinds of themes. But in the past few years, beyond Technic,
Star Wars
, and Disney, the Botanicals line has become something of a phenomenon. Whether it&#x27;s a miniature bonsai tree, an elegant orchid, or a vibrant bouquet, these are some of Lego&#x27;s most creative and best-designed sets.
And with
Valentine&#x27;s Day just 12 days away,
Lego flowers make an almost perfect gift. They can be a collaborative activity if you want; they never need watering, and they last forever. The
Bouquet of Roses
won&#x27;twon&#x27;t won&#x27;t lose its punchy red color and offers a fun, brick-built twist on the classic dozen. I&#x27;m also especially fond of the
Botanicals Mini Orchid
– currently down to just $23.95 on
Amazon
– which is a relaxing, enjoyable build with great color and a finished look that genuinely resembles the real thing.
The
Flowering Cactus
is another standout, featuring a lovely blue pot you&#x27;ll assemble alongside an iconic green cactus topped with a vibrant pink bloom. If you&#x27;re after something a little more classic, the equally charming
Succulents
set is well worth a look. I&#x27;ve also included a forthcoming Botanicals release that&#x27;s already sitting in my cart – Lego is finally tackling sunflowers in the form of a five-piece bouquet.

Following the debut of its
$10 Kallsup Bluetooth speakers at CES 2026
, Ikea is introducing another wireless speaker with a playful design and an affordable price tag. The Grejsimojs Portable Bluetooth speaker probably isn’t going to wow audiophiles, but it’s designed to look like a little purple mouse with a tail that can be used to carry it around.
The Grejsimojs speaker is currently available in countries like the
UK
and
Germany
for £12.00 and €14.99, respectively, which is around $16 to $18 in US dollars. It’s not available on the US...</div>

Sony’s flagship WF-1000XM6 earbuds have been leaked on a retail site
We don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;re coming out, but we have some specs and photos.

Sony&#x27;s long-anticipated flagship WF-1000XM6 earbuds have leaked online,
according to a report by
The Walkman Blog
and
posts on Reddit
. The retailer Power Buy posted a listing for the earbuds, complete with multiple photos and some specs.
Let&#x27;s get to the specs. We don&#x27;t know a lot, but the listing does suggest the earbuds will boast an IPX4 water-resistance rating and ANC/transparency modes. None of this is all that surprising, though we don&#x27;t have any details regarding the audio drivers or anything like that.

We do know what they look like, assuming the listing is accurate. There are two colorways, black and white, with a pill-shaped design that differs from the previous iterations. The case looks like a standard earbud case.

One interesting design aspect is that the eartips are slightly bigger than with previous models. This could indicate a larger air channel, which would translate to an increased bass response. Earbuds tend to struggle with bass, so this could be a nifty little upgrade.
However, that&#x27;s conjecture and we won&#x27;t know more until Sony does its own official drop. It&#x27;s been well over two years since the company released the
WF-1000XM5 earbuds
, so the refresh is long overdue.
