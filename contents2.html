        </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3 class="section-title">요약</h3>
                <div class="summary">Rivian’s founder and CEO RJ Scaringe is taking on a new role at his company as part of a restructuring ahead of next year’s launch of the R2 SUV, which involves a
layoff of more than 600 employees
. Scaringe told employees in an email on Thursday that he will be acting as Rivian’s chief marketing officer on an interim basis as the company searches for someone to fill that position for the first time. The head of Rivian’s “marketing experiences” team and the lead of the company’s creative studio will now report directly to Scaringe, according to a copy of the email obtained by TechCrunch. It’s not clear how many direct reports Scaringe already has — a spokesperson declined to comment — though he told the Decoder podcast last year that it was a “large number.”
“I am writing to share a difficult update,” Scaringe said in the email to Rivian’s staff. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams. These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”
Scaringe said the “changing operating backdrop” — a nod to the loss of the federal EV tax credit, increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and general headwinds against clean energy projects in the U.S. — forced the company to “rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”
In addition to Scaringe taking point on Rivian’s marketing and creative divisions, the company is also “streamlining” the customer experience, according to the email. Scaringe said Rivian is moving its “vehicle operations” team and integrating it with the company’s service division. Meanwhile, Rivian’s delivery and “mobile operations” will now live inside the sales division. These structural changes are being made to “ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery,” he wrote.</div>

Carl Franzen
October 23, 2025

Microsoft today held a
live announcement event online
for its Copilot AI digital assistant, with
Mustafa Suleyman
, CEO of Microsoft&#x27;s AI division, and other presenters unveiling a new generation of features that deepen integration across Windows, Edge, and Microsoft 365, positioning the platform as a practical assistant for people during work and off-time, while allowing them  to preserve control and safety of their data. The new
Copilot 2025 Fall Update features
also up the ante in terms of capabilities and the accessibility of generative AI assistance from Microsoft to users, so businesses relying on Microsoft products, and those who seek to offer complimentary or competing products, would do well to review them. Suleyman emphasized that the updates reflect a shift from hype to usefulness. “Technology should work in service of people, not the other way around,” he said. “Copilot is not just a product—it’s a promise that AI can be helpful, supportive, and deeply personal.”
Intriguingly, the announcement also sought to shine a greater spotlight on Microsoft&#x27;s own homegrown AI models, as opposed to those of its partner and investment OpenAI, which previously powered the entire Copilot experience. Instead, Suleyman wrote today in a
blog post:
“At the foundation of it all is our strategy to put the best models to work for you – both those we build and those we don’t. Over the past few months, we have released in-house models like MAI-Voice-1, MAI-1-Preview and MAI-Vision-1, and are rapidly iterating.”
12 Features That Redefine Copilot
The Fall Release consolidates Copilot’s identity around twelve key capabilities—each with potential to streamline organizational knowledge work, development, or support operations.</div>

Microsoft said earlier this month that it
wanted to add better voice controls to Copilot
, Windows 11’s built-in chatbot-slash-virtual assistant. As described, this new version of Copilot sounds an awful lot like another stab at Cortana, the voice assistant that Microsoft tried (and failed) to get people to use in Windows 10 in the mid-to-late 2010s. Turns out that the company isn’t done trying to reformulate and revive ideas it has already tried before. As part of a push toward what it calls “human-centered AI,” Microsoft is now
putting a face on Copilot
. Literally, a face: “Mico” is an “expressive, customizable, and warm” blob with a face that dynamically “listens, reacts, and even changes colors to reflect your interactions” as you interact with Copilot. (Another important adjective for Mico: “optional.”)
Mico (rhymes with “pico”) recalls old digital assistants like Clippy, Microsoft Bob, and
Rover
, ideas that Microsoft tried in the ’90s and early 2000s before mostly abandoning them. Microsoft clearly thinks that backing these ideas with language and/or reasoning models will help Copilot succeed where both Cortana and Clippy failed.</div>

Atlas Lion used phishing to infiltrate gift card systems and impersonate authorized employees
Attackers mapped infrastructure, avoided malware, and exploited internal workflows to steal gift cards
Gift cards are fast, untraceable, and easily resold; access lasted nearly a year
A Moroccan hacking collective has been targeting companies issuing gift cards for years, infiltrating their systems, stealing the cards, and likely reselling them on the black market for profit, new research has claimed. Researchers at Unit 42 from Palo Alto Networks dubbed the campaign “Jingle Thief”, since it’s most active during the festive season. As per the report, the group tracked as “Atlas Lion”, or “Storm-0539”, would first carefully pick its target, and try to learn as much about it as possible, before reaching out to its employees with convincing phishing lures. These lures would help them gain initial access, which they would then use to map out the IT infrastructure, with a specific focus on SharePoint and OneDrive. You may like

is a senior reporter covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme. EA is partnering with Stability AI, the company that develops the Stable Diffusion AI image model, to help infuse AI into its development processes. The two companies will “co-develop transformative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower our artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how content is built,”
EA says
. The company says that humans will still be “at the center of storytelling,” but “we’re evolving how we work so that AI becomes a trusted ally: supporting faster iteration, expanding creative possibilities, accelerating workflows, and allowing more time to focus on what matters most – building world-class games and experiences that entertain massive online communities.” EA adds that AI “can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream.</div>

Verizon&#x27;s latest ad defies CRT physics
One does not simply toss a 27-inch set to another human being. Igor Bonifacic
Senior reporter
Thu, October 23, 2025 at 8:24 PM UTC
Add Engadget on Google
A real Verizon commercial. (Verizon)
I know there are bigger fish to fry, but I wouldn&#x27;t be doing my job if I didn&#x27;t draw your attention to this travesty of a commercial Verizon just released. It&#x27;s only 30 seconds long but may go down as one of the worst ads I&#x27;ve ever seen. What’s so offensive, you ask? Well, the carrier (and one-time parent company of Engadget) wants to promote the fact that it will give AT&amp;T and T-Mobile customers a better deal on their wireless plan if they bring in their monthly cellular bill. That&#x27;s all well and good, but we need to talk about the cathode-ray tube TV that&#x27;s at the center of the commercial. The ad opens with a woman walking into a Best Buy-coded store and handing over a 27-inch CRT TV to a nearby sales associate. &quot;Hi, I got this old thing and the bill from the store where I got it,&quot; she tells the young salesperson while casually tossing the TV to him. &quot;Figured you could beat it with a better deal on one of these big boys,&quot; she adds, pointing to, let’s be honest, an
objectively worse flat panel TV

Now, I need to know: did anyone who worked on this commercial try to lift a CRT? Look, I know it&#x27;s 2025, and even the newest sets are now close to two decades old, but even if you&#x27;ve never seen one in real-life, surely you&#x27;ve heard how heavy they are? If I had to guess, the TV we see in the commercial, which looks like an
RCA 27R411T
, weighs close to 75 pounds. There&#x27;s a reason so many Facebook Marketplace listings recommend you bring a friend with you when you come pick up the CRT they&#x27;re selling; most people can&#x27;t lift even a mid-sized set on their own. I hate to think how Verizon made this commercial. CRTs are a dead technology.</div>

                <div class="summary">OpenAI unveiled its AI browser,
ChatGPT Atlas
, during a livestream on Tuesday. There are other AI browsers such as
The Browser Company’s Dia
,
Opera’s Neon
,
Perplexity’s Comet
, and General Catalyst-backed
Strawberry
. OpenAI’s launch is notable because of the sheer scale of reaching potentially 800 million of its weekly ChatGPT users. For the company, the browser is much more about keeping ChatGPT central than about making web browsing better.
While Atlas is currently available only on the Mac, the company is already working on bringing it to Windows, iOS, and Android — all the surfaces where ChatGPT already exists. OpenAI has also made the browser available to all users instead of opting for an invite system like its rivals. The core proposition of the browser is for you to think of ChatGPT as the first interaction surface for search and answers instead of Google.
All the AI browsers share a similar idea about search and Q&amp;A. Instead of performing a search query, you would type something in your address bar to get answers from an AI chatbot, instead of looking at pages of links.
And OpenAI, just like other browser makers, thinks that Atlas will change the way you browse the web, as Sam Altman made clear at the launch. “We think AI represents once in a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be, how to use one, and how to most productively use the web. Tabs were great but there hasn’t been a lot of innovation since then,” Altman said in his opening speech.
Tech leaders, including
Sundar Pichai
and
Satya Nadella
,
have talked about AI as a platform shift. However, for consumers, phones and desktop operating systems are still the primary way to get to their AI tools. OpenAI wants to own the pipes of distribution of ChatGPT as much as it can. Last week, Meta shut its doors to third-party chatbots, including
ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp
, which has over 3 billion monthly users.</div>

Simplifying the AI stack: The key to scalable, portable intelligence from cloud to edge
Arm
October 22, 2025
Presented by Arm
A simpler software stack is the key to portable, scalable AI across cloud and edge.
AI is now powering real-world applications, yet fragmented software stacks are holding it back. Developers routinely rebuild the same models for different hardware targets, losing time to glue code instead of shipping features. The good news is that a shift is underway. Unified toolchains and optimized libraries are making it possible to deploy models across platforms without compromising performance.
Yet one critical hurdle remains: software complexity. Disparate tools, hardware-specific optimizations, and layered tech stacks continue to bottleneck progress. To unlock the next wave of AI innovation, the industry must pivot decisively away from siloed development and toward streamlined, end-to-end platforms.
This transformation is already taking shape. Major cloud providers, edge platform vendors, and open-source communities are converging on unified toolchains that simplify development and accelerate deployment, from cloud to edge. In this article, we’ll explore why simplification is the key to scalable AI, what’s driving this momentum, and how next-gen platforms are turning that vision into real-world results.
The bottleneck: fragmentation, complexity, and inefficiency
The issue isn’t just hardware variety; it’s duplicated effort across frameworks and targets that slows time-to-value.
Diverse hardware targets
: GPUs, NPUs, CPU-only devices, mobile SoCs, and custom accelerators.
Tooling and framework fragmentation
: TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, MediaPipe, and others.
Edge constraints
: Devices require real-time, energy-efficient performance with minimal overhead.
According to
Gartner Research
, these mismatches create a key hurdle: over 60% of AI initiatives stall before production, driven by integration complexity and performance variability.</div>

Once upon a time, two villagers visited the fabled Mullah Nasreddin. They hoped that the Sufi philosopher, famed for his acerbic wisdom, could mediate a dispute that had driven a wedge between them. Nasreddin listened patiently to the first villager’s version of the story and, upon its conclusion, exclaimed, “You are absolutely right!” The second villager then presented his case. After hearing him out, Nasreddin again responded, “You are absolutely right!” An observant bystander, confused by Nasreddin’s proclamations, interjected, “But Mullah, they can’t both be right.” Nasreddin paused, regarding the bystander for a moment before replying, “You are absolutely right, too!”
In late May, the White House’s first “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) report was criticized for citing multiple research studies that did not exist. Fabricated citations like these are common in the outputs of generative artificial intelligence based on large language models, or LLMs. LLMs have presented plausible-sounding sources, catchy titles, or even false data to craft their conclusions. Here, the White House pushed back on the journalists who first broke the story before admitting to “
minor citation errors
.”
It is ironic that fake citations were used to support a principal recommendation of the MAHA report: addressing the health research sector’s “
replication crisis
,” wherein scientists’ findings often cannot be reproduced by other independent teams.
Yet the MAHA report’s use of phantom evidence is far from unique.</div>

The 2mm-thick mSSD reaches 6500MB/s write speeds despite its size
Longsys eliminates nearly 1,000 solder joints through wafer-level integration technology
The microSSD cuts defect rates from 1,000 DPPM to only 100
Longsys has introduced what it calls the industry’s first integrated-packaging microSSD, or mSSD, using a design which merges several key components into a single compact package.
The mSSD measures just 20 x 30mm and is only 2mm thick, weighing just 2.2 grams.
Despite its size, it supports PCIe Gen4x4 performance, reaching sequential read speeds of up to 7400MB/s and write speeds of up to 6500MB/s.

Integrated chip packaging
This device achieves random read and write figures of up to 1000K and 820K IOPS, respectively, keeping performance in line with larger M.2 drives.
Unlike traditional
SSDs
that rely on PCB assembly, the mSSD uses wafer-level System-in-Package (SiP) technology.
This approach integrates the controller, NAND flash, power management IC, and other passive components within one enclosure.
This eliminates nearly 1,000 solder joints typically found in PCB-based SSDs.</div>
