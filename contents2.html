                <div class="summary">Pintarnya, an Indonesian employment and financial services platform, has secured $16.7 million in a Series A funding round led by Square Peg. Founded in 2022, the company aims to address the challenges faced by Indonesia&#x27;s mass workers in finding jobs and accessing responsible lending. Co-founder Henry Hendrawan explained that the platform digitizes job matching with AI and provides safer, affordable lending options, moving away from traditional offline job searches and predatory lenders. A significant portion of Indonesia&#x27;s workforce is in the informal sector, lacking the documentation needed for formal financial services. Pintarnya overcomes this by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans. Since its 2022 seed funding, the platform has grown to serve over 10 million job seekers and 40,000 employers, with revenue increasing nearly fivefold year-over-year.

                <div class="source-content">Pintarnya, an Indonesian employment platform that goes beyond job matching by offering financial services along with full-time and side-gig opportunities, said it has raised a $16.7 million Series A round. The funding was led by Square Peg with participation from existing investors Vertex Venture Southeast Asia &amp; India and East Ventures. Ghirish Pokardas, Nelly Nurmalasari, and Henry Hendrawan founded Pintarnya in 2022 to tackle two of the biggest challenges Indonesians face daily: earning enough and borrowing responsibly. &quot;Traditionally, mass workers in Indonesia find jobs offline through job fairs or word of mouth, with employers buried in paper applications and candidates rarely hearing back. For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friend or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices,&quot; Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya, told TechCrunch. &quot;We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.&quot; Around 59% of Indonesia’s 150 million workforce is employed in the informal sector, highlighting the difficulties these workers encounter in accessing formal financial services because they lack verifiable income and official employment documentation. Pintarnya tackles this challenge by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral such as gold, electronics, or vehicles, Hendrawan added. Since its seed funding in 2022, the platform currently serves over 10 million job seeker users and 40,000 employers nationwide. Its revenue has increased almost fivefold year-over-year and expects to reach break-even by the end of the year, Hendrawn noted. Pintarnya primarily serves users aged 21 to 40, most of whom have a high school education or a diploma below university level.

                <div class="summary">A significant portion of a software developer&#x27;s time, as much as 84%, is spent on non-coding tasks, with context switching being a major drain on productivity. Research indicates that the average digital worker switches between applications up to 1,200 times daily, and it can take over 20 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption. This constant shifting between tools is a primary obstacle to efficiency. To address this, a new protocol from Anthropic, called MCP, is being explored. The goal is to keep developers within their integrated development environment (IDE) where they are most productive. By bringing necessary context directly into the IDE, MCP aims to reduce the need for developers to switch between different platforms, thereby optimizing their workflow and reclaiming a large portion of the time currently lost to operational and supportive tasks.</div>

                <div class="source-content">Software developers spend most of their time not writing code; recent industry research found that actual coding accounts for as little as 16% of developers’ working hours, with the rest consumed by operational and supportive tasks. As engineering teams are pressured to &quot;do more with less&quot; and CEOs are bragging about how much of their codebase is written by AI, a question remains: What’s done to optimize the remaining 84% of the tasks that engineers are working on? A major culprit to developer productivity is context switching: The constant hopping between the ever-growing array of tools and platforms needed to build and ship software. A Harvard Business Review study found that the average digital worker flips between applications and websites nearly 1,200 times per day. And every interruption matters. The University of California found that it takes about 23 minutes to regain focus after a single interruption fully, and sometimes worse, as nearly 30% of interrupted tasks are never resumed. Context switching is actually at the center of DORA, one of the most popular performance software development frameworks. In an era where AI-driven companies are trying to empower their employees to do more with less, beyond &quot;just&quot; giving them access to large language models (LLMs), some trends are emerging. For example, Jarrod Ruhland, principal engineer at Brex, hypothesizes that &quot;developers deliver their highest value when focused within their integrated development environment (IDE)&quot;. With that in mind, he decided to find new ways to make this happen, and Anthropic’s new protocol might be one of the keys. MCP: A protocol to bring context to IDEs.

Stephen Clark – Aug 24, 2025 2:51 pm | 128 SpaceX&#x27;s 10th Starship rocket awaits liftoff. Credit: Stephen Clark/Ars Technica. STARBASE, Texas—A beehive of aerospace technicians, construction workers, and spaceflight fans descended on South Texas this weekend in advance of the next test flight of SpaceX&#x27;s gigantic Starship rocket, the largest vehicle of its kind ever built. Towering 404 feet (123.1 meters) tall, the rocket was supposed to lift off during a one-hour launch window beginning at 6:30 pm CDT (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC) Sunday. But SpaceX called off the launch attempt about an hour before liftoff to investigate a ground system issue at Starbase, located a few miles north of the US-Mexico border. SpaceX didn&#x27;t immediately confirm when it might try again to launch Starship, but it could happen as soon as Monday evening at the same time. It will take about 66 minutes for the rocket to travel from the launch pad in Texas to a splashdown zone in the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia. You can watch the test flight live on SpaceX&#x27;s official website. This will be the 10th full-scale test flight of Starship and its Super Heavy booster stage. It&#x27;s the fourth flight of an upgraded version of Starship conceived as a stepping stone to a more reliable, heavier-duty version of the rocket designed to carry up to 150 metric tons, or some 330,000 pounds, of cargo to pretty much anywhere...</div>

Di Benedetto, expresses a long-held desire for a unified, upgradeable PC gaming setup that can be used anywhere, especially in the living room. While acknowledging the Steam Deck as a great handheld device, he finds it lacks the power needed for a seamless TV gaming experience. Previous attempts with gaming laptops and traditional desktops have been unsatisfactory due to noise, bulk, and the inconvenience of using Windows on a TV. The author reflects on the failure of Valve&#x27;s Steam Machine project, which he had hoped would be the solution. Now, he sees a new, promising path forward by combining the Framework Desktop with a Linux-based operating system called Bazzite, suggesting this combination comes very close to realizing the dream of a versatile, living-room-friendly PC gaming console.</div>

Bazzite can get you so close to the dream of PC gaming everywhere. by Antonio G. Di Benedetto. I’ve long dreamed of doing all my gaming on PC — a single platform that’s easily upgradeable and lets me play my overstuffed Steam library wherever and however I like. The Steam Deck is a fantastic handheld, but for my living room, I want something more powerful that works as well on my TV as it does at a desk. Believe me, I’ve tried.

The event will be livestreamed on the SpaceX website and X. However, the launch is uncertain due to a 45 percent favorable weather forecast, with backup dates on August 25 and 26. This flight follows a series of unsuccessful tests earlier in the year and a ground explosion in June. The objectives for Flight 10 include the deployment of eight dummy Starlink satellites and conducting experiments to enable the upper stage&#x27;s return to the launch site on future missions. The flight is planned to last just over an hour, concluding with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.</div>

The launch window opens at 7:30PM ET (6:30PM CT). As always, the flight test will be livestreamed on the SpaceX website and on X, with a webcast starting 30 minutes before launch. The weather is looking iffy for launch, though, so don&#x27;t be surprised if this one gets postponed; SpaceX said on Saturday that conditions were looking only 45 percent favorable. According to Space.com, the company has backup opportunities on August 25 and 26. Flight 10 follows a series of failures this year during SpaceX&#x27;s seventh, eighth and ninth test flights. And in June, a Starship vehicle exploded on the ground during preparations for a static fire test of its six Raptor engines. If all goes according to plan for Flight 10, Starship will deploy eight dummy Starlink satellites and perform &quot;several experiments focused on enabling Starship’s upper stage to return to the launch site.&quot; It won&#x27;t actually be returning to the launch site this time, though. The test is expected to last a little over an hour, and end with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.</div>

                <div class="summary">Sam Altman is in the process of co-founding a new brain-to-computer interface startup called Merge Labs and raising funds for it with the capital possibly coming largely from OpenAI’s ventures team, unnamed sources
told the Financial Times
.
The startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.
Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.
Merge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t
known until 2017
) and the company has made serious progress.
Neuralink is
currently in trials
with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It
raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion
valuation in June.
Neuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”
Long before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used
the term
to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960’s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.

about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,” he postulated at the time, citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.</div>

                <div class="summary">Russia’s
APT28
is actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.
Last month,
Ukraine’s CERT-UA
documented
LAMEHUG
, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.
Cato Networks’
researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.
Most startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.
The rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the
2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report
reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers
observe
in the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”

The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the<br>Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model<br>.<br>The legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background.

While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting.

Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.<br>The method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.<br>“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.&#x27;”<br>Six hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.<br>Welcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy<br>During his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.<br>To explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.<br>Another platform,<br>Nytheon AI<br>, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”<br>These aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer<br>“Claude Code”<br>clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.<br>Enterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface<br>Cato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.<br>Simonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.<br>When Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:<br>DeepSeek never responded<br>Google declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples<br>Microsoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work<br>OpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further<br>Six Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack<br>APT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality.

Underground platforms<br>offer identical capabilities for<br>$250 per month<br>. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.<br>Enterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per<br>Cato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report<br>. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.<br>Simonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction.

After more than a decade of development and testing, US military officials are finally ready to entrust United Launch Alliance&#x27;s Vulcan rocket to haul a batch of national security satellites into space.
An experimental military navigation satellite, also more than 10 years in the making, will ride ULA&#x27;s Vulcan rocket into geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket&#x27;s nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.
The Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There&#x27;s an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket&#x27;s Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA&#x27;s live launch webcast below.
The Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA&#x27;s new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.</div>

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket&#x27;s nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.<br>The Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There&#x27;s an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket&#x27;s Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA&#x27;s live launch webcast below.<br>The Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA&#x27;s new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.<br>Now, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers. The new rocket&#x27;s largest users, by far, will be Amazon and the US Space Force.<br>New and improved<br>&quot;We&#x27;re excited to see this mission launch,&quot; said Gary Wentz, ULA&#x27;s vice president of government and commercial programs. &quot;This will be the most powerful Vulcan yet.&quot;<br>The first two Vulcan test flights last year used a configuration of the rocket with two strap-on boosters to add an extra burst of speed off the launch pad. For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.<br>These boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters<br>fell off the launcher<br>moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.<br>The setback contributed to the delay of the Space Force&#x27;s first operational flight with the Vulcan rocket from the end of last year until now. Engineers determined that a carbon composite insulator, or heat shield, inside the nozzle failed to protect the nozzle&#x27;s metallic structure from the superheated exhaust coming from the booster. Investigators traced the cause of the failure to a &quot;manufacturing defect&quot; in one of the insulators, which led to the melting and burn-through of the booster nozzle.<br>The rest of the Vulcan rocket performed close to perfection on the two test flights last year, including the vehicle&#x27;s BE-4 main engines supplied by Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos. Two BE-4s fly on each Vulcan rocket, consuming cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen for the first five minutes of flight.<br>Space Force officials formally<br>certified the Vulcan rocket<br>for national security launches in March, setting the stage for Tuesday&#x27;s launch of the USSF-106 mission.<br>United Launch Alliance, a 50-50 joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is one of two companies approved to launch the Pentagon&#x27;s most expensive and sensitive satellites. SpaceX is the other one, and that company&#x27;s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets have overtaken ULA&#x27;s launch vehicles, thanks largely to booster reuse. Vulcan, like ULA&#x27;s legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, is currently designed for a single use. Eventually, ULA aims to recover and reuse the BE-4 engines themselves, but not the entire Vulcan core stage.<br>This will be the third flight of ULA&#x27;s Vulcan rocket, but the first to fly in a configuration with four solid-fueled boosters.<br>Credit:<br>          <br>          United Launch Alliance<br>Despite its higher cost and unproven capability, the Vulcan rocket won the lion&#x27;s share of US military launch contracts from 2020 through 2024, while SpaceX received a bit less than half of the launch orders the Pentagon put up for competition between the two providers. The balance shifted with a new round of launch contracts awarded in April, with SpaceX becoming the military&#x27;s leading launch provider and ULA taking second place. Blue Origin also won the right to receive a handful of military launch contracts with its New Glenn rocket, which debuted in January.<br>The Vulcan rocket checks off several important boxes for the Space Force. First, it relies entirely on US-made rocket engines. The Atlas V rocket it is replacing uses Russian-built main engines, and given the chilled relations between the two powers, US officials have long desired to stop using Russian engines to power the Pentagon&#x27;s satellites into orbit. Second, ULA says the Vulcan rocket will eventually provide a heavy-lift launch capability at a lower cost than the company&#x27;s now-retired Delta IV Heavy rocket.<br>Third, Vulcan provides the Space Force with an alternative to SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, which have been the only rockets in their class available to the military since the last national security mission was launched on an Atlas V rocket one year ago.<br>Col. Jim Horne, mission director for the USSF-106 launch, said this flight marks a &quot;pretty historic point in our program&#x27;s history.<br>We officially end our reliance on Russian-made main engines with this launch, and we continue to maintain our assured access to space with at least two independent rocket service companies that we can leverage to get our capabilities on orbit.&quot;<br>What’s onboard?<br>The Space Force has only acknowledged one of the satellites aboard the USSF-106 mission, but there are more payloads cocooned inside the Vulcan rocket&#x27;s fairing.<br>The $250 million mission that officials are willing to talk about is named Navigation Technology Satellite-3, or NTS-3. This experimental spacecraft will test new satellite navigation technologies that may eventually find their way on next-generation GPS satellites. A key focus for engineers who designed and will operate the NTS-3 satellite is to look at ways of overcoming GPS jamming and spoofing, which can degrade satellite navigation signals used by military forces, commercial airliners, and civilian drivers.<br>&quot;We&#x27;re going to be doing, we anticipate, over 100 different experiments,&quot; said Joanna Hinks, senior research aerospace engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory&#x27;s space vehicles directorate, which manages the NTS-3 mission. &quot;Some of the major areas we’re looking at—we have an electronically steerable phased array antenna so that we can deliver higher power to get through interference to the location that it&#x27;s needed.&quot;<br>Arlen Biersgreen, then-program manager for the NTS-3 satellite mission at the Air Force Research Laboratory, presents a one-third scale model of the NTS-3 spacecraft to an audience in 2022.<br>Credit:<br>          <br>          US Air Force/Andrea Rael<br>GPS jamming is especially a problem in and near war zones. Investigators probing the crash of<br>Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243<br>last December determined GPS jamming, likely by Russian military forces attempting to counter a Ukrainian drone strike, interfered with the aircraft&#x27;s navigation as it approached its destination in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Azerbaijani government officials blamed a Russian surface-to-air missile for damaging the aircraft, ultimately leading to a crash in nearby Kazakhstan that killed 38 people.<br>&quot;We have a number of different advanced signals that we’ve designed,&quot; Hinks said. &quot;One of those is the Chimera anti-spoofing signal... to protect civil users from spoofing that’s affecting so many aircraft worldwide today, as well as ships.&quot;<br>The NTS-3 spacecraft, developed by L3Harris and Northrop Grumman, only takes up a fraction of the Vulcan rocket&#x27;s capacity. The satellite weighs less than 3,000 pounds (about 1,250 kilograms), about a quarter of what this version of the Vulcan rocket can deliver to geosynchronous orbit.<br>Horne demurred when asked about what else the Vulcan rocket will deploy in orbit: &quot;<br>I’ll just say that any other further details beyond NTS-3 are not releasable to the public, and leave it at that...<br>We’re not going to make any further comments on anything beyond NTS-3 in the mission stack.&quot;<br>The Space Force&#x27;s refusal to disclose any information about additional payloads on the USSF-106 mission, even the total number of satellites aboard Vulcan, is somewhat of an outlier compared to the way military officials have historically handled these questions. While the Space Force has consistently kept secret details about specific maneuvers and instruments (or in some cases,<br>potential weapons<br>), officials have named and numbered the payloads carried aboard nearly all recent national security launches.<br>This is in contrast to the National Reconnaissance Office, which owns the US government&#x27;s fleet of spy satellites. The NRO has nearly always followed a stricter protocol of secrecy than the Air Force or Space Force.<br>That changed last year, when a classified Space Force mission named USSF-51 launched on an Atlas V rocket. Military leaders didn&#x27;t disclose the mission&#x27;s purpose or how many satellites it was carrying until the Space Force officially cataloged three payloads from the launch in its publicly accessible list of all human-made objects in orbit.<br>Some of the Space Force&#x27;s most secret satellites have the ability to release smaller spacecraft themselves, adding to the uncertainty for potential adversaries. Some information about the payloads on Tuesday&#x27;s launch might become public as the Space Force adds them to the public catalog, and a network of amateur skywatchers on Earth stands ready to observe their movements thousands of miles overhead.<br>Stephen Clark<br>Space Reporter<br>Stephen Clark<br>Space Reporter<br>Stephen Clark is a space reporter at Ars Technica, covering private space companies and the world’s space agencies.

It used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable
Watch SE
(now in its
second generation
) and, in 2022, the rugged
Apple Watch Ultra
(also now in its
second generation
). Suddenly, there are

of options.
Now that
the Series 10
has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up.</div>

You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS,<br>watchOS 11<br>, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of<br>watchOS 26<br>, which is slated to arrive in the fall.<br>What we’re looking for<br>How we test Apple Watches<br>Collapse<br>Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks.

We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin.

Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024,<br>no longer have this feature<br>. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)<br>What about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an<br>FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection<br>feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel.

I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to<br>basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market<br>— and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.<br>In this article<br>Should you get an Apple Watch?<br>Apple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?<br>The best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget<br>The best Apple Watch for kids<br>The best Apple Watch for older relatives<br>What’s coming next<br>Should you get an Apple Watch?<br>The Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block.<br>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge<br>The Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.<br>By their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.<br>The SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.<br>Polished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching.<br>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge<br>As for straps, we recommend the<br>nylon sport loop<br>, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.<br>Related<br>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now<br>The best iPhones<br>The best iPad to buy<br>The Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the<br>Trail Loop<br>, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.<br>And while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our<br>fitness tracker buying guide<br>.<br>Apple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?<br>8<br>Verge Score<br>Apple Watch Series 10<br>$<br>299<br>$<br>399<br>25<br>% off<br>$<br>299<br>The Good<br>Bigger display but not bulky<br>Wide-angle OLED is neat<br>Much faster charging<br>Sleep apnea detection has potential<br>The Bad<br>Lack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plans<br>Another year of minor updates<br>$299 at Amazon<br>$299 at Walmart<br>$299 at Best Buy<br>How we rate and review products<br>The latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update.

(Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes.

The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib.

If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.<br>What about blood oxygen?<br>As of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing<br>a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo<br>. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore<br>subject to an import ban<br>.<br>This doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer.<br>That said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on<br>any<br>wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They<br>cannot<br>and should not<br>replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from<br>Garmin<br>, the<br>Fitbit Charge 6<br>, the<br>Withings ScanWatch 2<br>, or the<br>Oura Ring<br>.<br>If battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who<br>wants<br>to be at that level.<br>You’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct<br>charging accessories<br>.<br>If you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.<br>The best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget<br>7<br>Verge Score<br>2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)<br>$<br>169<br>$<br>249<br>32<br>% off<br>$<br>169<br>The Good<br>S8 chip is still speedy enough<br>Offers the bulk of watchOS 11 features<br>Excellent entry-level watch<br>The Bad<br>The bezels are thick<br>Smaller display isn’t good for elderly relatives<br>No always-on display<br>Fewer sensors<br>$169 at Amazon<br>$169 at Walmart<br>$169 at Best Buy<br>How we rate and review products<br>The latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display).

Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either.

Elon Musk feels Apple favors OpenAI over xAI in App Store rankings

Elon Musk has
accused
Apple of committing an &quot;unequivocal antitrust violation&quot; by favoring OpenAI in the App Store rankings. In a post on X, he
claimed
that Apple has made it impossible for other AI companies to reach number one in those rankings and that xAI &quot;will take immediate legal action.&quot; Musk didn&#x27;t clarify what he meant by that, and he also didn&#x27;t provide evidence that would prove Apple&#x27;s supposed antitrust violation.
In an
earlier post
on X that&#x27;s currently pinned to the top of his profile, however, he tagged Apple, asking the company why it &quot;[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] &quot;Must Have&quot; section. He said X is &quot;the #1 news app in the world,&quot; while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. &quot;Are you playing politics? What gives?&quot; he continued. In a statement sent to
Bloomberg
, Apple
denied any wrongdoing
and said that the App Store &quot;is designed to be fair and free of bias.&quot; The spokesperson added: &quot;We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria. Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.&quot;
Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
posted a response
to Musk&#x27;s accusation on X, calling it a &quot;remarkable claim,&quot; given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates &quot;X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn&#x27;t like.&quot; To note, Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek
became the top-rated
free app on Apple&#x27;s App Store back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT.
While Musk didn&#x27;t mention it, Apple has an
ongoing partnership
with OpenAI.</div>
