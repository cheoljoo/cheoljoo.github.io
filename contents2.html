                <div class="summary">Governor Kathy Hochul has signed the RAISE Act, positioning New York as the second U.S. state to enact major AI safety legislation. State lawmakers
passed RAISE Act
in June, but following lobbying from the tech industry,
Hochul proposed changes
to scale the bill back. The New York Times reports
that Hochul ultimately agreed to sign the original bill, while lawmakers agreed to make her requested changes next year. The bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours. It will also create a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development. If companies fail to submit safety reports or make false statements, they can be fined up to $1 million ($3 million for subsequent violations). California Governor Gavin Newsom
signed a similar safety bill
in September, which Hochul referenced in
her announcement
. “This law builds on California’s recently adopted framework, creating a unified benchmark among the country’s leading tech states as the federal government lags behind, failing to implement common-sense regulations that protect the public,” Hochul said. State Senator Andrew Gounardes, one of the bill’s sponsors,
posted
, “Big Tech thought they could weasel their way into killing our bill. We shut them down and passed the strongest AI safety law in the country.”

While Gemini 3 is still making waves, Google&#x27;s not taking the foot off the gas in terms of releasing new models. Yesterday, the
company released FunctionGemma
, a specialized 270-million parameter AI model designed to solve one of the most persistent bottlenecks in modern application development: reliability at the edge. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, FunctionGemma is engineered for a single, critical utility—translating natural language user commands into structured code that apps and devices can actually execute, all without connecting to the cloud. The release marks a significant strategic pivot for Google DeepMind and the Google AI Developers team. While the industry continues to chase trillion-parameter scale in the cloud, FunctionGemma is a bet on &quot;Small Language Models&quot; (SLMs) running locally on phones, browsers, and IoT devices. For AI engineers and enterprise builders, this model offers a new architectural primitive: a privacy-first &quot;router&quot; that can handle complex logic on-device with negligible latency. FunctionGemma is available immediately for download on
Hugging Face
and
Kaggle
. You can also see the model in action by downloading the Google AI Edge Gallery app on the Google Play Store. The Performance Leap
At its core, FunctionGemma addresses the &quot;execution gap&quot; in generative AI. Standard large language models (LLMs) are excellent at conversation but often struggle to reliably trigger software actions—especially on resource-constrained devices. According to Google’s internal &quot;Mobile Actions&quot; evaluation, a generic small model struggles with reliability, achieving only a 58% baseline accuracy for function calling tasks.</div>

For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe. The
carbon border adjustment mechanism
(CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials. If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive. The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation. After a
trial phase
, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity. Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share.</div>

Hard drives still matter where capacity, cost efficiency and durability outweigh raw speed
Most modern hard drives are built for data centers, servers and specialized storage roles
Consumer hard drives are now rare, while enterprise, NAS and video drives dominate
Hard disk drives are often written off as legacy tech, but a closer look at what is still on sale tells a different story. After compiling a detailed list of 167 of the
best hard disk drives
worth buying, six clear points emerged about who is still making HDDs, what they’re building, and who they’re actually for. The first thing which stands out relates to brand. Western Digital has more drives on the list than anyone else, with 66 models spanning consumer, NAS, enterprise, and specialist categories. That range stretches from WD Blue consumer drives to WD Gold and Ultrastar models designed for data centers. You may like

The holidays have a way of sneaking up on us. One minute you’re trick-or-treating with your kids, and the next you’re panic shopping in a Buc-ee’s gift aisle. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With the right cheat sheet, you can keep the holiday spirit high and stress levels low. Fortunately, we did some planning on your behalf. As much as we love playing with the latest gadgets and gizmos here at
The Verge
, we also love recommending them. That’s why, after consulting with our expert team of writers and editors, we’ve compiled a medley of gift ideas that won’t be regifted come this time next year — from
noise-canceling earbuds
and
e-readers
to
retro-inspired Polaroid cameras
. Not every gift needs to be a grand gesture, though. Sure, a
new gaming handheld
makes for a great gift, but so does an
affordable power bank

Sony&#x27;s first EV with Honda will let you remotely play PS5 in your car

Faraway road trips just got a lot easier, at least for the passengers. Sony Honda Mobility
, the joint venture between the two Japanese conglomerates created to produce electric vehicles, announced that its
Afeela EV
will come with PS Remote Play. While playing video games in a car may be a niche feature, it means drivers will have something to do when parked, and passengers can chip away at their favorite RPGs during long drives. According to the announcement, the Afeela will be able to run your PS5 and PS4 consoles remotely through the infotainment system&#x27;s integrated display. You can even grab your
DualSense
controller from home and get right back into the game after jumping in your Afeela. Sony Honda Mobility said a 5Mbps broadband connection is required to play, and a 15Mbps rate will deliver a smoother experience. It&#x27;s not the first time we&#x27;re hearing about PS Remote Play in an EV. The joint venture previously showed off the Afeela 1, which is set for its first deliveries in 2026, and its ability to remotely play PlayStation titles at
CES 2024
. As for gaming in EVs overall, Tesla famously offered Steam support for its
Model S and X
, but later removed this feature. Advertisement

ChatGPT launches an app store, lets developers know it’s open for business
App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.”
In October, the company
announced
the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms—including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva—announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players. “Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday. OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s
OpenAI Developer platform
, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added. This is a big step for OpenAI towards expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. Topics

Building an enterprise AI company on a &quot;foundation of shifting sand&quot; is the central challenge for founders today, according to the leadership at
Palona AI
. Today, the Palo Alto-based startup—led by former Google and Meta engineering veterans—is making a decisive vertical push into the restaurant and hospitality space with today&#x27;s launch of Palona Vision and Palona Workflow. The new offerings transform the company’s multimodal agent suite into a real-time operating system for restaurant operations — spanning cameras, calls, conversations, and coordinated task execution. The news marks a strategic pivot from the company’s
debut in early 2025
, when it first emerged with
$10 million in seed funding
to build emotionally intelligent sales agents for broad direct-to-consumer enterprises. Now, by narrowing its focus to a &quot;multimodal native&quot; approach for restaurants, Palona is providing a blueprint for AI builders on how to move beyond &quot;thin wrappers&quot; to build deep systems that solve high-stakes physical world problems. “You’re building a company on top of a foundation that is sand—not quicksand, but shifting sand,” said co-founder and CTO Tim Howes, referring to the instability of today’s LLM ecosystem. “So we built an orchestration layer that lets us swap models on performance, fluency, and cost.”
VentureBeat spoke with Howes and co-founder and CEO Maria Zhang in person recently at — where else? — a restaurant in NYC about the technical challenges and hard lessons learned from their launch, growth, and pivot. The New Offering: Vision and Workflow as a ‘Digital GM’
For the end user—the restaurant owner or operator—Palona’s latest release is designed to function as an automated &quot;best operations manager&quot; that never sleeps.</div>

Guitarists today are spoiled for choice, and that goes doubly true for players who use computer-based amp modeling software. I’m one such player, and I don’t miss the size, weight, deafening volume, or cost of owning an amp and cabinet collection, to say nothing of all those pedals and cables. For clean to mid-gain tones alone, I already have more terrific options than I need, including NeuralDSP’s
Tone King
and
Cory Wong
and
Mateus Asato
, PolychromeDSP’s
Lumos
, and Universal Audio’s new
Paradise Guitar Studio
. All work slightly differently, but they can each output record-ready tones that are really,
really
close to the (often incredibly expensive) hardware that they model, and they each give you plenty of great-sounding presets to start from. So do we really need one amp sim package? NeuralDSP thinks we do, because the Finnish company just dropped a major new release yesterday called
Archetype: John Mayer X
. It doesn’t model Mayer’s
type
of gear but his
actual
hardware units, along with all the actual settings he uses in the studio and on stage. It even has some presets that he designed. Which is great if you want to sound like John Mayer—but what does the software offer for those of us not trying to cover
Continuum
? To find out, I spent a few hours playing with Mayer X, and I came away impressed. NeuralDSP has released so many metal amp sims in the last few years that I’ve come to associate the company with downtuned chugga-chugga. Don’t get me wrong: I like long hair, skulls, and palm-muted riffs as much as the next person, but it’s nice to have some variety. Mayer X’s effects pedal lineup.</div>

StorageReview’s physical server calculated 314 trillion digits without a distributed cloud infrastructure
The entire computation ran continuously for 110 days without interruption
Energy use dropped dramatically compared with previous cluster-based Pi records
A new benchmark in large-scale numerical computation has been set with the calculation of 314 trillion digits of pi on a single on-premises system. The run was completed by
StorageReview
, overtaking earlier cloud-based efforts, including
Google
Cloud’s 100 trillion digit calculation from 2022. Unlike hyperscale approaches that relied on massive distributed resources, this record was achieved on one physical server using tightly controlled hardware and software choices. You may like
