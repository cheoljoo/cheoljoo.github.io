                <div class="summary">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company&#x27;s annual revenue exceeds $13 billion, addressing concerns about its ability to fund over $1 trillion in computing infrastructure commitments for the next decade. During a Bg2 podcast interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Altman reacted testily to host Brad Gerstner&#x27;s questions regarding these financial reports. Altman asserted that revenue is growing steeply and challenged critics, suggesting they would eagerly buy OpenAI shares or short the stock if it were public, anticipating they would &quot;get burned&quot;. He acknowledged potential pitfalls, such as failing to secure sufficient computing resources, but expressed confidence in the company&#x27;s financial trajectory.</div>

                <div class="summary">This article introduces a new paradigm in CPU architecture: deterministic, time-based execution, moving away from the long-standing speculative execution model. Speculative execution, dominant since the 1990s, aimed to prevent pipeline stalls by predicting branch outcomes and memory loads, leading to significant performance gains. However, it incurred costs like wasted energy from failed predictions, increased complexity, and security vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown.

Inspired by David Patterson&#x27;s principle of simplicity, a new deterministic model has emerged. This breakthrough, detailed in six U.S. patents, assigns each instruction a precise execution slot using a simple time counter. This time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism replaces guesswork with a time-based, latency-tolerant mechanism. Each instruction is assigned a precise execution slot within the pipeline, resulting in a rigorously ordered and predictable flow of execution. This reimagined model redefines how modern processors can handle latency and concurrency with greater efficiency and reliability.</div>

                <div class="summary">Elon Musk and Sam Altman continue their public feud on X. The latest exchange began with Altman posting screenshots about his attempt to cancel a 2018 Tesla Roadster reservation and get a refund, citing a 7.5-year delay. Musk responded by accusing Altman of stealing a nonprofit, referencing past criticisms, lawsuits, and takeover bids related to OpenAI&#x27;s restructuring. Musk also started a rival AI startup, xAI, and is suing OpenAI and Apple for alleged collusion. Furthermore, Musk claimed Altman&#x27;s screenshots were incomplete, stating the refund issue was resolved within 24 hours.</div>

                <div class="summary">A recent research article by Apple, &quot;The Illusion of Thinking,&quot; argues that large reasoning models (LRMs) cannot think and only perform pattern-matching, citing their inability to carry out calculations with predefined algorithms as problems grow. This article counters that argument, stating it&#x27;s flawed because humans also fail at complex algorithmic tasks like the Tower of Hanoi with many discs. The author claims that LRMs almost certainly can think, defining thinking in relation to problem-solving, which involves problem representation (frontal and parietal lobes), working memory, attention, executive functions, and encoding symbolic structures.</div>
