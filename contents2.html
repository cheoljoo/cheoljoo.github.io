ChatGPT launches an app store, lets developers know it’s open for business
App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.”
In October, the company
announced
the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms—including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva—announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players. “Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday. OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s
OpenAI Developer platform
, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added. This is a big step for OpenAI towards expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. Topics

Building an enterprise AI company on a &quot;foundation of shifting sand&quot; is the central challenge for founders today, according to the leadership at
Palona AI
. Today, the Palo Alto-based startup—led by former Google and Meta engineering veterans—is making a decisive vertical push into the restaurant and hospitality space with today&#x27;s launch of Palona Vision and Palona Workflow. The new offerings transform the company’s multimodal agent suite into a real-time operating system for restaurant operations — spanning cameras, calls, conversations, and coordinated task execution. The news marks a strategic pivot from the company’s
debut in early 2025
, when it first emerged with
$10 million in seed funding
to build emotionally intelligent sales agents for broad direct-to-consumer enterprises. Now, by narrowing its focus to a &quot;multimodal native&quot; approach for restaurants, Palona is providing a blueprint for AI builders on how to move beyond &quot;thin wrappers&quot; to build deep systems that solve high-stakes physical world problems. “You’re building a company on top of a foundation that is sand—not quicksand, but shifting sand,” said co-founder and CTO Tim Howes, referring to the instability of today’s LLM ecosystem. “So we built an orchestration layer that lets us swap models on performance, fluency, and cost.”
VentureBeat spoke with Howes and co-founder and CEO Maria Zhang in person recently at — where else? — a restaurant in NYC about the technical challenges and hard lessons learned from their launch, growth, and pivot. The New Offering: Vision and Workflow as a ‘Digital GM’
For the end user—the restaurant owner or operator—Palona’s latest release is designed to function as an automated &quot;best operations manager&quot; that never sleeps.</div>

Guitarists today are spoiled for choice, and that goes doubly true for players who use computer-based amp modeling software. I’m one such player, and I don’t miss the size, weight, deafening volume, or cost of owning an amp and cabinet collection, to say nothing of all those pedals and cables. For clean to mid-gain tones alone, I already have more terrific options than I need, including NeuralDSP’s
Tone King
and
Cory Wong
and
Mateus Asato
, PolychromeDSP’s
Lumos
, and Universal Audio’s new
Paradise Guitar Studio
. All work slightly differently, but they can each output record-ready tones that are really,
really
close to the (often incredibly expensive) hardware that they model, and they each give you plenty of great-sounding presets to start from. So do we really need one amp sim package? NeuralDSP thinks we do, because the Finnish company just dropped a major new release yesterday called
Archetype: John Mayer X
. It doesn’t model Mayer’s
type
of gear but his
actual
hardware units, along with all the actual settings he uses in the studio and on stage. It even has some presets that he designed. Which is great if you want to sound like John Mayer—but what does the software offer for those of us not trying to cover
Continuum
? To find out, I spent a few hours playing with Mayer X, and I came away impressed. NeuralDSP has released so many metal amp sims in the last few years that I’ve come to associate the company with downtuned chugga-chugga. Don’t get me wrong: I like long hair, skulls, and palm-muted riffs as much as the next person, but it’s nice to have some variety. Mayer X’s effects pedal lineup.</div>

StorageReview’s physical server calculated 314 trillion digits without a distributed cloud infrastructure
The entire computation ran continuously for 110 days without interruption
Energy use dropped dramatically compared with previous cluster-based Pi records
A new benchmark in large-scale numerical computation has been set with the calculation of 314 trillion digits of pi on a single on-premises system. The run was completed by
StorageReview
, overtaking earlier cloud-based efforts, including
Google
Cloud’s 100 trillion digit calculation from 2022. Unlike hyperscale approaches that relied on massive distributed resources, this record was achieved on one physical server using tightly controlled hardware and software choices. You may like

The calculation ran continuously for 110 days, which is significantly shorter than the roughly 225 days required by the previous large-scale record, even though that earlier effort produced fewer digits.</div>

verification feature to videos
made or edited with the company’s own AI models. Users can now ask Gemini to determine if an uploaded video is AI-generated by asking, “Was this generated using Google AI?”
Gemini will scan the video’s visuals and audio for Google’s proprietary watermark called
SynthID
. The response will be more than a yes or no, Google says. Gemini will point out specific times when the watermark appears in the video or audio. The company rolled out this
capability for images
in November, also limited to images made or edited with Google AI. Some watermarks can be
easily scrubbed
, as OpenAI learned when it launched its Sora app full of exclusively AI-generated videos.</div>

Apple keeps most of its product pricing on a tight leash, but we do see the company&#x27;s AirTags go on sale pretty frequently. Another cost cut has come around for this item just in time for the holidays. Amazon is currently selling a four-pack of
AirTags
for $65. At a third off the regular cost, that price is pretty close to the record low discount of $63 we&#x27;ve seen for these Bluetooth trackers. Apple

If you place an order quickly, the AirTags should arrive in time for Christmas, making this a solid choice as a gift for someone with a tendency to misplace stuff. AirTags can also be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you&#x27;re on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for
useful accessories
to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product. Advertisement

AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11.</div>

                <div class="summary">YouTube has won exclusive rights to stream the Oscars starting in 2029, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
announced
on Wednesday. The Google-owned platform outbid other contenders, including the Oscars’ longtime home ABC, ending the network’s streak of hosting the awards show since 1976 (with the exception of a
brief period
in the early 1970s). YouTube’s first show will be the 101st Oscars in 2029, and its deal will run through 2033. ABC will continue to broadcast the ceremony until 2028. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The news, which marks a landmark shift for one of television’s marquee events, highlights YouTube’s
growing dominance in the television space
and a major shift as streaming takes on more live events. The ceremony will be available live and for free to more than 2 billion viewers globally on YouTube, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States. The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences. “We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”
As part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more.</div>

Gemini 3 Flash arrives with reduced costs and latency — a powerful combo for enterprises

Enterprises can now harness the power of a large language model that&#x27;s near that of the state-of-the-art
Google’s Gemini 3 Pro
, but at a fraction of the cost and with increased speed, thanks to the
newly released Gemini 3 Flash
. The model joins the flagship Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Deep Think, and Gemini Agent, all of which were announced and released last month. Gemini 3 Flash, now available on Gemini Enterprise, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, AI Studio, and on preview in Vertex AI, processes information in near real-time and helps build quick, responsive agentic applications. The company
said in a blog post
that Gemini 3 Flash “builds on the model series that developers and enterprises already love, optimized for high-frequency workflows that demand speed, without sacrificing quality. The model is also the default for AI Mode on Google Search and the Gemini application. Tulsee Doshi, senior director, product management on the Gemini team, said in a
separate blog post
that the model “demonstrates that speed and scale don’t have to come at the cost of intelligence.”
“Gemini 3 Flash is made for iterative development, offering Gemini 3’s Pro-grade coding performance with low latency — it’s able to reason and solve tasks quickly in high-frequency workflows,” Doshi said. “It strikes an ideal balance for agentic coding, production-ready systems and responsive interactive applications.”
Early adoption by specialized firms proves the model&#x27;s reliability in high-stakes fields. Harvey, an AI platform for law firms, reported a 7% jump in reasoning on their internal &#x27;BigLaw Bench,&#x27; while Resemble AI discovered that Gemini 3 Flash could process complex forensic data for deepfake detection 4x faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro.</div>

One of the big stories of last year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was the debut of Donut Lab’s
diminutive but powerful electric motors
. When I spoke with Donut earlier this year, the company told me that it was looking at applications ranging from drones to large automotive motors, but also things like wind turbines and even washing machines. Now, almost a year later, we have our first look at an electric vehicle that uses the technology, thanks to a new collaboration between Donut Lab and WATT Electric Vehicle Company. WATT had previously developed the Passenger and Commercial EV
Skateboard
(PACES), a lightweight aluminum platform for low-volume EVs. Now, it’s integrating Donut’s motors, first with one for each rear wheel, although there will eventually be an all-wheel-drive variant, too. The small EV chassis is rather intriguing—with the motors in the rear wheel hubs, the layout is even more space-efficient than a more conventional EV, which still needs to find a few cubic feet to package its drive unit(s).</div>

The Academy and YouTube ink Oscars deal
The 101st Oscars will stream on YouTube
The event has aired on ABC for almost 50 years
And the Oscar goes to... YouTube
. Google
&#x27;s streaming video giant has just secured the 2029 Academy Awards show and the surrounding red-carpet events. The telecast will be leaving Disney-owned ABC, its home since 1976. It&#x27;s a big moment for streaming TV and, perhaps, an unfortunate sign of the times for linear, a.ka. broadcast TV. Just this year,
streaming surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable
(the split is 44.1% for the pair and 44.8% for streaming), according to Nielsen. Live events like the Oscars and sports have been one of the ways in which linear TV still wins, but streamers like Netflix,
Amazon
,
Apple
, and others have been partnering with major sports leagues to bring the live games to their platforms (Apple has the MLB and MLS, Amazon Prime has some NFL games). Award shows, however, had held fast to broadcast and cable – until now. In recent years, Disney has also streamed the Oscars on Disney+ and Hulu.</div>
