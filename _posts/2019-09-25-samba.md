# how to use multiple login
- windows memorizes with \\name\xx
- So we can have multiple login from windows to same samba server
    - connection 1 : IP address   ex) \\10.1.1.2\conn1_ip
    - connection 2 : ServerName   ex) \\charles.com\conn2_charles
    - connection others : using alias hostname - change your DNS file : \WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

# using net use command
- it supports only one connection simultaneously. but you can change it.

## command
- check current status
    - `net use`
- delete
    - `net use \\10.1.1.2\conn1_ip delete`
- add
    - `net use \\10.1.1.2 * /user:conn1_ip`
